That's because he is LN, which gives him a lot more depth than most good or evil deities. And wouldn't you know it? Helm's LN, too. Two of the most morally ambiguous and complex deities in the setting. By the way, you ever read <em>Bloodwalk</em> by James P. Davis? One of the main characters is a Hoarite ghostwalker. He's awesome. So if you like the novels and haven't read this one, I'd give it a go. I enjoyed it.<br /><p><br /></p></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#22</p>The_Silversword</p>Sep 20, 2009 19:31:40 </td><td valign = "top"><p>I'll have to check that book out!

Well, I suppose they figured the Triad was all that was needed in Celestia, and that a neutral god didn't fit. And if I remember correctly, Hoar already dwelled in the Barrens of Doom and Despair. So Bane already had him eyed up, he just needed to close the deal.

Actually, Hoar sat just fine with Torm, hence why he and Tyr kept trying to win over Hoar for ages.

I'm sure you have some being a follower of the Lord of Three Thunders and all.<br />But fine I'll go again:</p><br /><p>Even Some More Even More Hoar Lore:<br /><strong>Dogma:</strong> Hoar charges his clergy to uphold true and fitting justice and to maintain the spirit of the law, not the letter of the law. Fitting recompense will always accure for one's actions. Violence will meet violence and evil payback evil, but good will also come to those who do good. One must be careful to walk the line of Hoar's teachings, to seek retribution, but to fall not into pursuing evil acts for evil's sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one's downfall. Vengence must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged. Those who do not respond to attacks against their person or that which they hold dear only invite future attacks.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#60</p>sfdragon</p>Oct 01, 2009 16:30:40 </td><td valign = "top"><p></p><blockquote><br /><p>Hoar is pleased.</p><br /><p></p></blockquote><br /><br />but not with you</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#61</p>LordManshoon</p>Oct 01, 2009 17:15:42 </td><td valign = "top"><p></p><blockquote><br /><p></p><blockquote><br /><p>Hoar is pleased.</p><br /><p></p></blockquote><br /><br />but not with you<br /><p></p></blockquote><br />

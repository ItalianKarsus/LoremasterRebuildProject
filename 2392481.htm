I dont know if that was ever officialy stated but it mades sense to me. All these dwarves born from the thunder blessing could all pursue a career in wizardry, even though thier forfathers could not.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#4</p>JudgeDookie</p>Oct 22, 2009 21:41:24 </td><td valign = "top"><p>I know that.</p><br /><p>I was talking about anything <i>new</i>.</p><br /><p>People, just so we don't stumble upon a repeat of the previous two posts, Silversword guy is correct--the Thunder Blessing was partly brought in to explain why dwarves could suddenly use the arcane in 3e. Primarily, though, its purpose was to increase the dwarven population, which was declining at a drastic rate, due their low fertility rate and the amount of conflict the dwarven race as a whole was dealing with, producing casualties faster than births. Moradin bestowed this blessing on his children so that they would multiply and live on.</p><br /><p>So...does anyone have any more than this?</p></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#5</p>dookies_altar_ego</p>Oct 27, 2009 2:05:15 </td><td valign = "top"><p> </p><br /><p>Anyway, back to the Thunder Blessing.</p><br /><p>Has anyone talked to the designers about this?</p><br /><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#6</p>The_Silversword</p>Oct 27, 2009 2:14:41 </td><td valign = "top"><p></p><blockquote><br /><p> </p><br /><p>Anyway, back to the Thunder Blessing.</p><br /><p>Has anyone talked to the designers about this?</p></blockquote><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><p>But any way I dont think any one has asked the designers about it.

Treat<br />mainland Faerun as a place to visit, hunt, explore,<br />inhabit for short periods...just not "home" (because<br />it hurts too much).<br /><br />In the same way, dwarves in decline (yes, also<br />Tolkien-ish) was necessary to explain the predominant<br />position of humans (in the early D&amp;D rules, which all<br />of us if we wrote anything for DRAGON or TSR had to<br />follow) in the game. Otherwise, there was just no way<br />the humans were going to dominate (orcs were posited<br />as even more fecund, and nastier, pound for pound,<br />too: why hadn't THEY taken over?). I talked on several<br />occasions with Jim Ward (who played in Gary's 'home'<br />Greyhawk campaign) and read material written by both<br />Gary and by Rob Kuntz (who played and sometimes DM'ed<br />Gary's campaign) and yes, dwarves WERE in decline in<br />Greyhawk, too...not necessarily in every place or in<br />specific regions, but overall, as humans expanded,<br />they were declining from a previous 'golden age.'</em></p><br /><p><em> </em></p><br /><p><em> </em></p></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#15</p>18DELTA</p>Oct 27, 2009 22:51:12 </td><td valign = "top"><p>Interesting...</p></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#16</p>JudgeDookie</p>Oct 28, 2009 0:10:48 </td><td valign = "top"><p>((Removed))</p><br /><p> </p><br /><p></p><blockquote><br /><p>hey dookie, The Most Esteamed Ed Greenwood has replied that the Thunderblessing is heavily NDA'd</p><br /><p></p></blockquote><br /><br /><p>Thanks, sf--appreciate you going to a source.

Just because I am novel biased (having now played both 4E and 4E Realms I am no longer novel <i>only</i>) does not mean that I don't recognise the subserviant position that lore has to the game.

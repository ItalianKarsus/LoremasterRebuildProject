Sure!  It happens that I actually wrote a travelogue about Brightwater for the Candlekeep Compendium, it might be useful to you.  Check it out here:  <a href="http://www.candlekeep.com/compendium/Candlekeep_Compendium-Volume_VI.zip" title="Candlekeep Compendium Vol. VI" rel="nofollow"></a><a title="http://www.candlekeep.com/compendium/Candlekeep_Compendium-Volume_VI.zip" href="http://www.candlekeep.com/compendium/Candlekeep_Compendium-Volume_VI.zip" rel="nofollow">www.candlekeep.com/compendium/Candlekeep...</a> even though it was written in a storytelling/travelogue style, all known facts about Brightwater were compiled from canon sources, and then I extrapolated the rest based on educated guesses.<br /><p>In addition, there are a number of planar articles in other issues of the Candlekeep Compendium that you might be interested in.  You can download them from this link here: <a href="http://www.candlekeep.com/compendium/index.htm" rel="nofollow"></a><a title="http://www.candlekeep.com/compendium/index.htm" href="http://www.candlekeep.com/compendium/index.htm" rel="nofollow">www.candlekeep.com/compendium/index.htm</a> some of them have maps.  Brian James has a lot of planar lore in his forgotten realms articles for Dragon magazine.  His Auril article is particularly keen.  Check it out here: <a href="http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/drrl/20080926" rel="nofollow"></a><a title="http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/drrl/20080926" href="http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/drrl/20080926" rel="nofollow">www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/d...</a></p><br /><p></p><blockquote>The astral plane is a bit esoteric in the Great Tree format, but it makes sense.

The Astral Plane was essentially the same, same silver void, the Githyanki lived there, most everything that applied to the Great Wheel Astral applied to Faerun's Astral.  The channeled Astral concept was introduced in the 3e Manual of the Planes, and that one feature was selected by the 3E FR design team to apply to Toril's Astral Plane.<br /><p>Essentially, the idea was that when you cast a spell that utilized the Astral to transit to another plane, you had to name your exit plane and that was the only plane to which you could leave the Astral.  You could spend as much time in the Astral as you wanted, but while you were there, only color pools that lead to your named destination plane would be available to you.  And then when you left an outer plane, the only destination you could name was Toril's Prime Material Plane.  If you wanted to travel from, say Brightwater to Arvandor, you had to first travel to the Prime Material and then recast your spell to go back through to Arvandor.   Toril was thus the crossroads of the cosmology and extra planar beings would often materialize in Toril on their way to some other planar destination.</p><br /><p>There were some ways around this.  The Blood River (Styx) and the Celestial Tree (Yggdrasil) could let you travel between planes without passing through Toril.  There were also portals, planar rifts, planar breaches, soft borders, chaos ships, certain special spells, and several other methods for bypassing Toril.  But the regular plane shift spell and Astral travel were supposed to work in the channeled fashion.  There is some info about how it works in the intro to the planes chapter of the Players Guide to Faerûn.</p><br /><p>But aside from that, use any lore you like regarding the Astral from other planar sources or Planescape books, no reason that the vast majority of that lore wouldn't also fit Toril's Astral.  I am especially fond of the <strong><i>Guide to the Astral Plane</i></strong>, which is a great resource for the Astral, if you don't have it already.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#13</p>The_Silversword</p>Nov 16, 2009 21:45:29 </td><td valign = "top">This was brought up in another thread ( the language thread of all places) but I thought it would make more sense to continue the conversation here. So the jist of it is this, Does the Realms have its own Astral Sea and Elemental Chaos or do all D&amp;D worlds share the same planes? Are these planes are part of Realmspace? Does Abeir have its own Shadowfell and Feywild? Does Abeir still exist in Realmspace, or is it Abeirspace?  so what does anybody else think?</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#14</p>gray_richardson</p>Nov 16, 2009 22:22:38 </td><td valign = "top"><blockquote>Does the Realms have its own Astral Sea and Elemental Chaos or do all D&amp;D worlds share the same planes? </blockquote><br />
Officially, it's own.  Although, as a DM you are free to change this.  You might think of FR's astral domains as an archipelago in a vast sea.  It may be possible for you to sail beyond the archipelago for a very, very far distance, and encounter another cluster of Astral domains that represent the cosmology of another world, such as Greyhawk or Eberron.  Spelljamming still exists, as does phlogiston, which connects the disparate worlds and cosmologies of the D&amp;D universe.  These cosmologies are connected in other ways such as the portals of Sigil, planar rifts, planar breaches, gates, soft borders, special artifacts, etc.<blockquote>Are these planes are part of Realmspace?</blockquote><br />
Not exactly, Realmspace is a volume of Material Plane space contained in a crystal sphere a little larger than the diameter of Toril's solar system.  Toril's crystal sphere floats in the Phlogiston, which may or may not be a manifestation of the Shadow Plane as it is perceived in the area that is coterminous with whatever area exists outside of crystal spheres.  Or more accurately, the Material Plane ends at the boundaries of the crystal sphere, and what lies outside is the Shadow Plane, which is perceived as the Phlogiston. The Shadowfell may be that region of the Shadow Plane that is coterminous with Toril.  But this is unexplored so far under 4e rules.<blockquote> Does Abeir have its own Shadowfell and Feywild?</blockquote><br />
No definite answer, except that Rich Baker has expressed the opinion on the Boards that Abeir and Toril may share the same planar cosmology.  Abeir and Toril inhabit two alternate material planes that are separated by a planar barrier of some kind.  You could surmise that they do share the same planar cosmology, or you could decide that they have a duplicate alternate cosmology that may resemble, in part Toril's planes, with some notable differences.  For instance, Dragon Eyrie and the Mulhorand pantheon's Heliopolis might still exist in Abeir's cosmology, and draconic deities might be way more abundant, or even dominant among the gods of Abeir. <blockquote>Does Abeir still exist in Realmspace, or is it Abeirspace?</blockquote><br />
It is an alternate material plane.  It has never been charted on a Spelljamming map that I have seen.  Perhaps, though, it has its own crystal sphere that orbits in synchrony with Toril's, like a double-star system, floating in tandem in the flow of the Phlogiston.  But if so there might need to be some explanation as to why such a neighboring crystal sphere has not been noticed to date.  Perhaps some illusion cast by Leira similar to how she hid the true surface of Selûne.  Alternatively you might see Abeir and Toril as coterminous with one another occupying the same metaphysical space, but slightly out of phase with one another.  Abeir might then actually be within Toril's crystal sphere, just out of phase with Toril.  Under that scenario it would be unclear if you could spelljam from Toril to a neighboring planet within Realmspace or if Ao cloned the entire solar system to be out of phase along with Abeir.  This lore has just not been established as far as I know so far in 4e. <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#15</p>The_Silversword</p>Nov 16, 2009 22:52:02 </td><td valign = "top">Thank you Gray_Richardson! I was hoping you would show up. So the main puzzler here seems to Abeir. Ive heard reasons why it wouldnt have a Shadowfell and Feywild and why it would, and both arguments have merit. It does specify in the Realms Campaign Guide that it was a twin of Toril not the whole of Realmspace, Im just wondering if you were on Abeir in a Spelljamming vessel  and left Abeir where would you end up? Would you be in another plane like the Shadowfell or is there an Abeirspace? Or what about other planets in Realmspace? I would assume they they all have Shadowfells and Feywilds too. By the book the Shadowfell and Feywild overlap with Toril, but I think thats just how the inhabitants of the planet see it, obviously theyre all going to see Toril as the center of it all. The way I see it the Shadowfell and Feywild overlap with all of Realmspace, not just Toril. So I guess that would be Feyspace, and Shadowspace?</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#16</p>gray_richardson</p>Nov 16, 2009 23:40:31 </td><td valign = "top"><blockquote>Im just wondering if you were on Abeir in a Spelljamming vessel  and left Abeir where would you end up?</blockquote><br />
If I were deciding, I would say that Ao duplicated all of Toril's crystal sphere, an exact physical clone of all the planets as they existed at the time of the cloning.  He pushed Abeir into an alternate material plane that is coterminous with Toril's crystal sphere but out of phase with Toril along some other-dimensional axis.<br /><br />He then gathered all the gods and primordials together in the hall of Cynosure and made them sign a compact, perhaps a portion of the Tablets of Ao, and then choose souls to populate each world, using complex rules negotiated by Ao between the parties, but which may have looked like captains choosing up teams for an incomprehensibly massive highschool soccer game. Those beings that were aligned with gods ended up in Realmspace, those aligned with Primordials ended up in Abeirspace.  Obviously the majority of dragons and giants ended up in Abeirspace, but obviously some stayed behind, and likewise many humans and demihumans ended up in Abeirspace.  This division may have extended to the other planets of Realmspace.  Although it is conceivable that those planets may have ended up unpopulated, in Abeirspace.  I don't know if the war extended as far as the populations of the other planets in Realmspace.  Although, if I put my mind to it, there are probably some wonderful stories to be told about what the Divine/Primoridal war was like on each of the other planets in Realmspace.<br /><br />I would imagine that Abeir might have started out with no links to Toril's Astral, and may not even have had an Astral plane of its own, but that perhaps one formed over time by the collective beliefs and psychic energies of Abeir's inhabitants, especially those who fostered a belief in gods.  So I figure Abeir eventually formed its own Astral that looks different from Toril's.<br /><br />However, I see Abeir being connected to the same Shadowfell and Feywild as Toril, as those already have properties that are similar to a material plane.  In fact in 1e they were called the positive material plane and the negative material plane (later changed to the positive energy plane and the negative energy plane) as opposed to the Prime Material Plane where the campaign world was set.  Now technically the Shadow Plane was originally something else, possibly a demi-plane or some sort of fourth type of material plane that reflected the interplay of light and darkness where the Negative Material Plane and the Positive Material Plane intersected, but I digress.  As of 4e the negative energy plane and the Shadow Plane have been folded into the Shadowfell, presumably by Shar I think is the official explanation. <blockquote>Would you be in another plane like the Shadowfell or is there an Abeirspace?</blockquote><br />
I think if you used a spelljammer to leave Abeir, you would be in the wildspace that exists within the boundaries of Abeir's crystal sphere and you could fly to the cloned worlds of Glyth, H'Catha, etc.--or whatever names they go by--within Abeir's solar system.<br /><br />Were you to leave Abeir's crystal sphere, my guess is you would find yourself in the Phlogiston, the one and only Phlogiston, which I believe is an extension of the Shadowfell, aka the Shadow Plane as it exits outside the crystal sphere.  And to support this lore I rely on the 3e Manual of the Planes which established that the Shadow Plane was the primary way to travel between alternate material planes and cosmologies.<blockquote>Or what about other planets in Realmspace?  I would assume they they all have Shadowfells and Feywilds too.</blockquote><br />
My take is that the Feywild has a "feyspace" that is coterminous with Toril's solar system (and also Abeir's solar system) and that you could spelljam within the Feywild to the feywilds of H'Catha, Glyth, Anadia, Coliar, etc.  I believe there is also a shadowspace, that leads to shadowfell versions of those planets as well.  However, you may not need to shadowjam within the Shadowfell, as the rules of travel there may be quite different, and using certain spells you might be able to shadowalk for vast distances without the aid of a ship, maybe even vertically up into shadowspace... you might even be able to shadowalk to Shadow-Coliar, etc.  I have conceived that the Shadowfell may have a region of Deep Shadow that is used for Shadow-walking and for inter-cosmology travel, which is analogous to the concept of the Deep Ethereal from prior editions.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#17</p>The_Silversword</p>Nov 17, 2009 0:28:06 </td><td valign = "top"><blockquote>  I have conceived that the Shadowfell may have a region of Deep Shadow that is used for Shadow-walking and for inter-cosmology travel, which is analogous to the concept of the Deep Ethereal from prior editions.</blockquote><br /><br /><br />Yes I like it! That does make alot of sense. I think I might use that as well. <br /><br />And ive been sittin here thinkin on Abeirspace, at first I wasnt so sure that such a thing existed, I was just thinking that just Toril was cloned, and Abeir existed alone as its own demiplane, but after thinking on it im starting to see it now, after all Abeir didnt exist in total darkness, so it probably has a sun that it orbits as well, so yeah I agree, Ao just didnt clone Toril, but all of Realmspace. IM still a little unsure of how to fit Abeir into the cosmology as far as the Astral Sea and Shadowfell are concerened. It would make sense for there to be an overlap with the Realmspace cosmology. I might be thinking to hard on this, it is a fantasy world after all, and it doesnt necessarily have to make sense, and the planes and gods exist beyond mortal understanding so it may be impossible to come up with an absolute answer. <br /><br />If Abeir does share the same Shadowfell as Toril it seems like travel between the two would be more frequent, they way it is in the book, they are very separate and only overlap very rarely. Hopefully we'll see some more info on Abeir, and the other Realms planes in general, Theres enough to work with there for them to make a Manual of the Planes book dedicated solely on the Realms cosmology.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#18</p>suin_bahhar_02</p>Nov 17, 2009 11:51:32 </td><td valign = "top">Out of Phase dual dimensional star systems Batman! Heavy Stuff going on here, but we're on to something. So this picture is a moderately correct dipection of the collision of Abeir and Toril?<br /><br /><img src="http://www.areavoices.com/astrobob/images/thumbnail/Dusty_binary_with_planet_collisionSMALLLynette_Cook.jpg" alt="Dusty_binary_with_planet_collisionSMALLLynette_Cook.jpg" width="500" height="333" /><br />The two planetoids Toril and Abeir would normally be out of phase when they collide (once in a year) but they went into and out of each others phase with potentially disastrous transposing and colliding effects.<br /><br />Very nice musings  on Abeirspace Gray, but I think it would make sense that Abeir's crystal sphere was copied with the intention that the primordials could rule over it absolutely (or more easily). It would have had a cosmology with a stronger connection to the elemental chaos (if you look at the picture you see its natural surface is a lot more grey and ashen, which I can Imagine would happen on a elemental dominated planet). This could mean that its shadowfell didn't transition the souls towards the Fugue, an astral domain of Kelemvor, but towards the Abyss or somekind of elemental shard in the Elemental Chaos functioning as a soul collecter for use as sustenance of Primordial archlords.<br /><br />Ao might have been able to shunt Abeirspaces dimension in a place floating above or trough the elemental chaos. Abeirs sun, stars and a moon (or two) could very well be closer to the natural world than in Toril as in D&amp;D these orbital elements ususally are essences built from the elemental planes. I think that the elemental nature of Abeir clearly shows in its genasi, draconic and elemental giant inhabitants, who would be able to thrive in such a more rugged place.<br /><br /><br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#19</p>The_Silversword</p>Nov 17, 2009 14:42:00 </td><td valign = "top">Heavy stuff indeed! Interesting pic there, but i dont think it was an actual physical collition, more like a phaze thing except certain landmasses traded off for what ever reason. Im guessing that Abeir orbits the other way around the sun compared to Toril, so they would only actually overlap once in every year or something like that. Im still trying to fit this all into my head, Im curently working on making a sort of planar map of the Realms Cosmology, still not sure how to fit Abeir in there, it would make since for it to be a clone of Realmspace, and they share the same planes, but with no gods, it wouldnt really make sense for them to have an Asrtal Sea, unless they do have gods, Some primordials and titans obviously stayed on Toril, so maybe some of the gods went off to Abeir? It would definalty make more sense for Abeir to have more of a connection to the Elemental Chaos, than Toril, maybe on Abeir the Elemental Chaos works more like the Shadowfell and Feywild does on Toril.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#20</p>suin_bahhar_02</p>Nov 17, 2009 17:23:35 </td><td valign = "top">Aye the collision was like a dimensional phasing one, but the wild magic energies made some parts more fully real during it. That way the transposing could occur during the passing. I think its more interesting if this was not without violent transdimensional earthquakes and tremors.<br /><br />Abeir could have an empty astral sea as it would have a lack of those island domains the gods typically reside in. And like Gray said some could have been formed afterwards; some comparatively "tiny" isolated domains could drift in the astral, having been formed later on through the importation during the phaseshift or by evolution of new religions and gods during Abeirs history. <br /><br />In my eyes the Feywild or the plane of Fearie is slightly problematic though. As I see it the Feywild enveloped Torils natural world upon which it copied or adapted much of its geography. Ancient Abeir might have been used as a blueprint aswell so that could explain why the Feywild has very different actual topography. Its copy blended both Toril and Abeirs geographic locations into a magically primal natural place inbetween to two.<br /></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#21</p>18DELTA</p>Nov 17, 2009 17:50:47 </td><td valign = "top">Maybe during the "phasing" Mystra's Weave was transplanted into Abeirspace?</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#22</p>The_Silversword</p>Nov 17, 2009 18:10:10 </td><td valign = "top">Im guessing Abeirspace had its own Weave, which was also destroyed in the Spellplauge, but i dunno, maybe magic worked a little differently in Abeir with more of a focus on Elemental power.

Although, I kinda always thought that Kereska was just a fragment/alias/aspect of Mystril in her draconic guise. So I am not sure if Kereska, or any of the draconic deities (including Bahamut and Tiamat) had a presence in Abeir, for the reason that they are gods and may not have held any dominion in Abeir.<br /><br />But another intriguing possibility is that Abeir may not have had a weave at all if there was not any corresponding god (or primordial) to control it.  If so, then the inhabitants of Abeir may have developed 4e style magic long ago and been knowledgeable about how to access raw magic without a weave for millennia.  If that's the case, then it could have been the dragonborn and other inhabitants of Abeir that crossed over during the Spellplague that gave Faerûnians insights and secrets into accessing raw magic and allowed them to rediscover and rebuild the discipline of using the art of magic very quickly, in less than a century.<br /><br />If so, then had some magically adept Abeirians not crossed over, perhaps Faerûn would still be in a magical dark age to this day, with little to no knowledge of how to access the raw mystical forces present in the world in the absence of a weave.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#26</p>18DELTA</p>Nov 20, 2009 1:34:36 </td><td valign = "top">What about the Eladrin that came from the Feywild, Grey?

Toril's material plane) and the weave extended to the Astral Plane, at least into the Dweomerheart.  Corellon was the god of magic for the elves, and this may be because Mystra/Mystril didn't have a presence in the Feywild, she was a material plane goddess.  While the Feywild had Archfey or fey paragons.<br /><br />Of course, I have always felt strongly that Mystril was just the human aspect/alias of the god of magic.  For Ed Greenwood, Lurue was originally his goddess of magic.   Of course, before humans existed Mystril was an entity that did not have human form, per se, and may have been venerated by the creator races under an aspect appropriate to the conception of the people who worshiped her.  For instance, Mystril may have been worshiped by the undersea aquatic creator race (the forebears of the Batrachi, prior to their transformation into land-dwelling frog people) as some sort of silver octopus.  The Sarrukh were monotheists, while some view the World Serpent as a distinct god, I think he may have been a gestalt deity, kind of like the Adama, where all the portfolios of all the gods were wrapped up in one concept and worshiped collectively as the World Serpent, so for the Sarrukh, the World Serpent was an aspect of Mystril, but also inclued Chauntea, Amaunator, etc. Just a theory...  Anyway, for the Fey creator race, the Leshay, I like to think Mystril was worshipped as Lurue.  Or actually, the other way around, humans worshipped Lurue under the guise of Mystril.  My feeling is that Mystril and Lurue are either the same deity or are fragments of the original god of magic that have become separate with time (in the way that plants bud off from each other to form new plants, or in the way that amoeba split by mitosis), and because gods in the same pantheon cannot have the same portfolio, the Lurue fragment, as she became known to humans through their interaction with elves and fey, and became re-incorporated into the Faerunian pantheon as a separate entity, lost the magic portfolio to the other fragment of herself.  But I digress.  The point I am trying to make is that I don't know to what extent Lurue was known in the Feywild.  I think Mystril might not have governed the weave of the Feywild, not sure if it had a weave, but if Lurue was known there then it might be evidence that the Feywild had a weave and that the influence of Mystril was exercised on that weave under the guise of Lurue, her fey aspect.  But for all we know, Lurue may have only been a god of the Material Plane fey that lived on Toril, and Lurue may or may not have been known in the Feywild.<br /><br />All this is to say that, I think it possible that perhaps the Feywild did not have a weave, and that it was filled with raw magic that was accessible without a weave using the peculiar magics that were known to the Fey of the Feywild.  Note that the Fey that came to Toril form Tintageer, the Sun and Moon elves (aka the eladrin) had different magical practices, such as their version of epic magic and cooperative magic that was very different from the magical "technology" known to the Netherese, which had come down to them from the Batrachi, Aearee, and Sarrukh through the Nether Scrolls, a compendium of the magical lore of the elder races compiled by the Ba'etith, a magical society or guiding council that sought to pass on and perpetuate magical knowledge, probably at the behest of Mystril/Lurue/Silver Octopus/World Serpent.  The Ba'etith fulfilled the same function in the Days of Thunder as Mystril's "chosen" or "magisters" do in the modern era.<br /><br />But I keep digressing.  To sum up.  My impression is that the Weave did not extend to the Feywild or the Shadowfell.  But, I need to research this as Ed Greenwood, I think, has mentioned something to the effect that the Weave did not extend to the Planes, but I am not sure if I am remembering it correctly, and vaguely recollected lore is a dangerous thing.  I actually think there is an answer one way or another in established lore how far the Weave extended to the other planes, if it did so at all.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#28</p>18DELTA</p>Nov 20, 2009 3:52:21 </td><td valign = "top">Interesting.<br /><br />Thanks Grey.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#29</p>The_Silversword</p>Nov 20, 2009 4:30:22 </td><td valign = "top">Yes, very interesting!

However, Simon &amp; Schuster seems to now have it being released in March 2010, in North America.<br /><strong>As for the Feywild and Abeir having a Weave, the answer is: yes and no.<br />I'm not trying to be funny or evade the question.<br />Here's why I say both: the Feywild and Abeir, like the Realms we've long known about, have the same sorts of natural forces (wind energy, solar, tides and flowing water, convection currents, gravity, the kinetic energy of soil creep, continental drift and rising and falling tectonic plates and vulcanism, the chemical energies of all flora and fauna, and so on). What was dubbed "The Weave" in Faerun was a way of harnessing these energies, a means of calling on them to power specific effects (spell results). It was a trial-and-error-developed means of making things happen. Divine magic is one set of means, arcane magic another, and "the Weave" was a shorthand term for (one way of) understanding how to connect with and control all of these natural energies.<br />So the Feywild and Abeir will have their own "Weaves," akin to that of the Realms but subtly different, that may well be called something else locally.<br />As to those differences, it's something like going to a distant country and trying to plug your toaster into an electrical socket on the wall and discovering the plug won't even fit - - and if you do get it in, the toaster will probably catch fire or blow a fuse. You are encountering an electrical system, yes, but it works differently than the one you're used to. You can readily learn how to use the new local system if you had familiarity with your own system, but if you try to blunder or bull ahead without allowing for the differences, the results are going to be disappointing, perhaps spectacularly so.<br />Or to put it another way, a Weave is like the Linnaean method of cataloguing living things (Latin species names, divisions into genus, phyla, family, and so forth). There are other ways of cataloguing those same living things, and they aren't altered merely by being catalogued one way or another.<br />Heh. And just like real-world science and/or classification systems, wizards (and priests) in the Realms can get in to all sorts of arguments over the Weave.<br />As can gamers, in forum discussions. </strong>:}</blockquote><br /><br /><br />I have already asked ED a question, to contribute to this thread.

Arambar, Grumbar... any relation I wonder?) sacrificed his life to create a sky to give life and light to the world.  It's metalic hue makes me think he might have been a draconic-style primordial of a metallic bent.  Perhaps a sibling, or son to Bahamut.  Alternatively he might have been a twin of Grumbar, the Earth Lord, as a "soil and sky" duality suggests itself.  They might have had a Zeus, Hades &amp; Poseidon type brotherhood trinity going on. <br /><br />Of course, all we really know is that Arambar is dead now.  So perhaps he was alive until recently.  Maybe he was killed in the Spellplague, and the Steelsky is the residue from his death.   Maybe prior to that, Arambar simply installed himself in the sky as Abeir's sun--in the same fashion as Amaunator was Toril's sun (with whom Arambar could have had some kind of rivalry, back in the day, before or during the War).<br /><br />Or maybe he is still alive in Abeir, but "dead" in Returned Abeir, where, cut off from Abeir proper, the memory of his vast power still lights the sky.<br /><br />Hey, maybe Arambar was not set in the sky, but was some colossal titan, many miles high, that shone like a sun and walked the surface of Abeir eternally, shedding light and warmth, taking 24 hours to walk the circumference of Abeir each day, in great strides, his burning footprints scorching a desert around Abeir's equator where none dare cross.  Or maybe Arambar sailed a ship around the perpetually boiling "ring sea" that circumscribes Abeir's globe. (that one would still preserve the sea, sky and soil trinity--assuming there is one--if Arambar gets the sea, possibly also in combination with the sky; of course it could have just been a sea &amp; soil duality).  Arambar doesn't even have to look human.  He could have been a dragon that flies around the skies.  Or a great, rolling orb that tumbles across the surface of Abeir.  Maybe he looks like a giant, rolling, fiery eyeball.  Or a crab.  Or a really fast snail...<br /><br />Of course, maybe there was no single initial solution to Abeir's darkness.  Maybe the Primordials, being a willful and divisive lot, each originally championed different lighting solutions.  There could have been competing suns, lamps, glowing empyrean shells, fiery trees, volcanoes, burning towers, balefires, celestial jewels, roving titan torch-bearers, etc.  Heck, maybe this devolved into its own war, a war that "burned the sky", before some final solution ultimately prevailed.   Maybe Arambar was instrumental in resolving that conflict and was invested, or usurped for himself, the duty to light Abeir.  Or perhaps this was the moment when Arumbar was killed, or sacrificed himself, and his body was used to form the Steelsky, in the same way that Ymir's skull became the sky, Ouranos' corpse became the heavens, or that Anu/Enlil/Marduk crafted the vault of the heavens from the ribs of Tiamat.<br /><br />Lots of great potential here for myth and story.  I really like the idea that Abeir ended up in a void, and something creative had to happen to light the sky.  In fact, I think I will be sad if the official lore gets revealed to be something more mundane.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#50</p>suin_bahhar_02</p>Nov 25, 2009 14:18:12 </td><td valign = "top">A lot of nice ideas over here, need to let them simmer awhile. I am partial to your musings on the War that Burned the Skies mythos you just dreamed up. Excellent stuff.<br /><br />Kossuth, Ishtishia, Grumbar and Akadi, i.e. the primordials that held relations with Toril even after the seperation of Abeir from Toril could have been exiles or refuge seekers from Abeir when such an Epic war was taking place. It could also be that they are proof of elemental pathways (pathways through the Elemental Chaos) that lingered to and from Abeir and Toril. Summoning techniques that bring forth elementals perhaps unknowingly tapped on lost Abeir, and were perfected by Raumathari mages when they summoned that Avatar of Kossuth to Toril during the Great Conflagration against the Nar armies.<br /></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#51</p>The_Silversword</p>Nov 25, 2009 16:05:50 </td><td valign = "top">Yes, some very interesting stuff guys.

In previous editions of D&amp;D scholars thought that stars in crystal spheres were points in the phlogiston where the elemental plane of radiance came through into the material plane.

A perpetual grey light could sustain what possible elemental plantlife there is on Abeir. Stars and other celectial bodies fall within the portfolios of the gods so its possible that they are lacking in Abeir.  They might be there beyond the pocketplane but highly obscured from vision, like looking through murky glass. It would likely look a bit like this pic below; vague clues from celestial activity could be deduced but most would be impossible to follow. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.spectrumglass.com/stained-glass/img/products/water/100w.JPG" alt="100w.JPG" width="432" height="432" /><br /><br />Ra and his highly sun dependant worship would have to fight through the steelsky barrier to reach his faithful Mulhorandi people.

The players traveled through a mirror to a Nerra cathedral/nexus and freed the imprisoned nobles and merchants.  And it's been enough time that I could pull some of the plot threads left dangling from that adventure back into the story. <br /><br />I don't want to rip off Carroll, exactly, and I don't really see the Plane of Mirrors as an analog to Carroll's looking glass realm, but I think one could certainly use elements from Carroll, subtly, as a nod.  Maybe use the names of chess pieces as ranks, or as titles of nobility, or code names for key NPCs.  Or have a puzzle challenge involving a room with a black &amp; white tiled floor requiring movement in specific patterns, like chess moves.  I am also intrigued with the idea of using armies or factions representing the four suits of a card deck--or maybe Tarot suits.  There might be an encounter with a Jabberwock, or evil twins, or a caterpillar (glass carrion crawler?), Cheshire displacer beasts?  Cheshire weretigers?

Or perhaps some sort of anti-Shadowplane--like a photographic negative of the Shadowplane (makes me think back to math class, where a negative number multiplied by a negative number is a positive amount, but the square root of a negative number is imaginary).  Or maybe the Plane of Mirrors is a complement to the Plane of Shadows in that it is a reflection of the Material Plane at the border between the Material Plane and the Positive Energy Plane.  I haven't yet sussed out the metaphysics.  The mind boggles.  But I think there is something there to explore.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#64</p>The_Silversword</p>Dec 15, 2009 0:26:10 </td><td valign = "top">Ok so i get it now, The Plane of Mirrors, connects to all the Prime Material Planes throughout the Multi-Verse, kinda like the Plane of Shadows, but through mirrors, so perhaps it has a sort of connection with the Plane of Shadows or Shadowfell, whatever you want to call it.

Everything in PoL specific books is designed that you can use it in as many places as possible and isn't loaded with a ton of specific fluff binding it to one place. The City of Brass in Manual of the Planes works equally well in FR as it does in the default PoL setting. Some places do take some more modification to fit with FR than others, but where this is hardest is generally where you have PoL specific Gods and FR specific Gods interfering. This isn't a problem with all PoL books though and is easily corrected from say Manual of the Planes (where Gods in that live on different planes than in FR and have different relationships). <br /><br />Plane Below doesn't really have so many problems in this regard, what probably will have lots of problems it the counterpart book Plane Above. That will probably descibe planes like Celestia and such, which will involve some influence from the PoL Gods that FR lacks. <br /><br />I've never seen the point of sidebars and have argued in the past they are a waste of space. For one thing they are never comprehensive enough to be truly useful. Where something should be comprehensively covered in another setting, it should get a <strong>good</strong> dedicated dragon or dungeon article for it, not a piddly 1/2 page sidebar that doesn't do much to address the problem it's causing in that setting anyway. The other problem is with a new campaign every year you're going to need to address these problems across every campaign you release. This is just taking stuff away from new content from books that are written generically enough they are designed to be easily adaptable into those campaigns anyway (again, I'll give anyone that the likes of Divine Power is substantially more difficult with FR and other campaign settings - that's why they should get Dragon articles bringing the campaign specific fluff for those books).<br /><br />I will somewhat be contradictory here and note sometimes the odd small sidebar is appropriate, as the entry for Jalanvaloss in Draconomicon II is informative and highly appropriate as it's an FR Dragon being bought into the PoL setting. Here is gets a small sidebar giving a quick explanation that she's still around, has some diminished power and is working on rebuilding her wealth and influence. This doesn't take a lot of room and the rest of the entry focuses on being able to use the creature in <strong>all</strong> campaign settings.<br /><br />This is the core point though at the end, I'm buying the default PoL books so I can use all the material as much as possible in any game. I don't always run FR and I'm equally favouring running Eberron. I don't want books where large chunks of books are trying to explain every little thing for the numerous campaign settings various contradictions and problems over new, further convertable and interesting content. A 1/2 page FR/Eberron sidebar soon turns into a full page of content that is lost, where I could have a full page of new interesting stuff for <em>any future campaign setting</em>.<br /></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#73</p>Doombringer_of_Hoar</p>Dec 17, 2009 11:41:17 </td><td valign = "top">My main problem is that almost all the fluff is too tied in with the Points of Light setting.

I haven't read that particular book yet. My comment was more directed at the core books in general. That's not really the topic here so I was in the wrong there and I apologize, especially being as that I am always smiting people for going off topic. So I guess now, by my own code, I must SMITE myself. OW!<br /><br />But back to the topic, I don't think this particular book would have problems fitting in with the other settings being as they all now have the same planar cosmology, with the possible exemption of Dark Sun.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#77</p>Aegeri</p>Dec 17, 2009 22:25:23 </td><td valign = "top">Dark Sun already is defiling just about every core 4E tenant with campaign settings. It doesn't have a players guide (It has a campaign guide, monster manual specific to it and an adventure), brings a lot of new mechanics into the game (but does not introduce new classes) and it's the first campaign setting that functionally removes a power source in 4E (Divine). In the same way though, things in Dark Sun like the races and mechanics can be used in any other 4E campaign as there isn't a need to "power things up" in DS (a 1st level character in 4E is rather like a level 3 character in previous editions - Dark Sun powered characters up in 2E as they weren't survivable enough otherwise - something they don't have to do). <br /><br />Personally I'm looking forward to the new gladiator and similar options in Dark Sun that I can use elsewhere, but I'm definitely going to be running the setting. The good thing is that in 4E terms, things like books full of monsters will always be universally useful. I doubt I will be able to get much use out of the Plane Below in Dark Sun though, but I'm going to get tons of use out of it in both Eberron and FR so I can't complain.<br /></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#78</p>Doombringer_of_Hoar</p>Dec 17, 2009 22:35:42 </td><td valign = "top">Yes I am definitely looking forward to Dark Sun. I am curious how it will fit in with the planes. I'm guessing it will have more of a connection to the Elemental Chaos, and virtually no connection to the Astral Sea, or it might be more separated from all the planes. Guess we'll just have to wait and see.</td></tr></table></body></html>

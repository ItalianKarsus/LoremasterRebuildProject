And it's also been specified that souls can be completely obliterated, their existence permanently destroyed so that they exist nowhere. The final book of the War of the Spider Queen made that clear, as did the final book of the Lady Penitent. So yes, they <span style="text-decoration:underline">can</span> be all-out destroyed. It's relatively simple to obliterate a soul, as well, based on what we've seen. The destruction of Dweomerheart would easily bring about total destruction, so that only a handful of <strong>very</strong> lucky ones would survive. So, ultimately, almost all of them would have been destroyed, based on the most recent FR lore we've seen.<br /><p></p><blockquote><br /><p>Yea, I agree.

It's not eventually accomplished in those cases; it's immediately accomplished.<br /><p> </p><blockquote>It's like trying to change the amount of energy/matter that exists in the universe.

Except this is fantasy, as Erianthe said. The laws of the real world need not apply. This is especially true considering we've seen souls obliterated in novels, which just happen to be canon. It may be hard to believe, but it's there.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#16</p>Nolwelen</p>Oct 28, 2009 16:40:16 </td><td valign = "top"><p>Fair enough.

Thanks. This gave me a chuckle.<br /><p>You might have missed the point. You said you believed souls in FR are indestructible, so I provided lore which clarifies that statement: they are not. You need not accept such lore in your own game, and no one is forcing you to obey the lore. However, the OP was asking for canon, and my focus has been on canon. The idea that souls are indestructible has been disproven in FR lore, hence why I've been posting what I've posted.

Given the context of the discussion, which was canon, your "I believe" came across not as "In my opinion", but as "If I'm remembering correctly" or "To my knowledge"; as if you thought souls were indestructible, and that no lore existed which said otherwise. What you meant was not what was interpreted.

The souls of Hammergrim went down with the ship after Laduguer and Deep Duerra bit the dust. That plane went out with a whimper, and not a bang, though.

What does "destroy" realy mean. In the common sense it always refers to a "structure" being disolved. Did you ever hear the quote:"God is dead?" It's one of the more prominent things <strong>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche </strong>is supposed to have said. But the idea is, it doesn't necessarily mean god isn't almighty anymore. It doesn't mean he is gone just because he is dead. Well this isn't about religion, what I'm trying to say is that destruction in the natural world isn't an ultimative thing. It's actually somthing else, it's very rapid change of a structure, nothing more and nothing less.</p><br /><p>To me the death of Mystra has a very clear up side. Selune gets more spotlight. In the past she always stud in Mystra's shadow.  But now she plays the role she is supposed to have. After I realized Lathander was gone, and he actually really is gone in a sense, I had to look for another favorite deity, and even though I always liked Ilmater I now ended up in Selune's camp. Lately I startet to read "the Law of Attraction" and I came to the conclusion that Ilmater's focus on suffering and pain is way too far on the negative side of perceiving the world and therefore I chose Selune as being the deity who gets the most of my "support" in the FR.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#43</p>The_Silversword</p>Oct 29, 2009 9:01:51 </td><td valign = "top"><p>I knda liked Nietzsche, sure he might of been a little insane, but he wrote some interesting stuff.

I imagine they'd dwell on either the Fugue Plane or the Gates of the Moon. Any others seem a stretch.  Khelben is a special case, because his resting place was chosen as a reward for fulfilling his duties (and that elven blood in his veins). Should Qilue's soul ever be found (which I don't think is going to happen, as pessimistic as that may sound), I think she'd also get the pass to Arvandor. The others, though, don't have the claim to the elven paradise, and will probably end up in one of the first two.

I seriously doubt Ed would consider making El a god, and based on CP's interview (you know, the one that generated almost no interest), it seems the idea to make El a god has been tossed aside for the moment.

Great link man! What about Core Elven? Is it the same as Realms Elven? </blockquote><br />
Well... this is a tricky question.  First off, Realms Elvish has its own font.<img height="596" width="1023" alt="espruar font" src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p130/Aelred/NWN2/Misc/3rdedespruar.jpg" /><br /><p>This was introduced in the 3e Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide.</p><br /><p>Not sure if the 4e elven font was intended to replace the 3e font or not.  From a lore perspective, I would say not.  But perhaps the core elven font could be seen as the alphabet used by eladrin from the Feywild and as such it would have certainly gained currency in the Realms since contact has increased with the Feywild in the last 100 years.  That could indicate that the core elven alphabet may be the same as the ancient elven alphabet known as Hamarfae that was used to write the ancient elven language called Seldarin that elves spoke back when they first arrived from Tintageer in the Feywild circa -25,400 DR.</p><br /><p>Although, alternatively, you could make a case that the 2e elven font best represents hamarfae <img height="475" width="700" alt="2e espruar" src="http://www.fontstock.net/images/Espruar--Elvish-FR-_big.jpg" /></p><br /><p>I would advocate that core elven is probably a modern dialect of Seldarin that is spoken in the Feywild that is written with the admittedly beautiful 4e elven script.</p><br /><p>Now Faerûnian elven is not quite the monolithic language that it is portrayed as for game purposes.  In game terms it is often treated as one language.  But in actuality elven consists of multiple languages, or at least multiple dialects of the same language that sound markedly different from one another.  Drow is in fact an elven dialect that has morphed quite a bit from the original Seldarin (or other eladrin dialect).  And you can assume that surface elven diverged to some degree or another wherever populations of elves set up kingdoms and settlements around Faerûn and became isolated from other populations.  Elven would have diverged into dialects similar to the way in which Latin diverged into French, Spanish, Italian (and all the various Italian sub-dialects), Occitan/Provencal, Rumansch, Romanian, Portuguese, Vulgar Latin, Ecclesiastical Latin, etc.</p><br /><p>Because elves are so long lived and have long memories as well as institutional memory preserved by their culture, linguistic drift might be glacially slow in the elven tongue.  Thus, elven dialects may be quite mutually comprehensible.  Yet, over the course of almost 27,000 years, there has certainly been measurable linguistic change.  If the Drow tongue is any indication of what changes time has wrought, then other elven dialects may have experienced similar amounts of linguistic drift.  Although, the pressures exerted by the struggle for survival in the Underdark on the Dark Elves combined with the cultural rejection by the topside elves may represent a unique combination of circumstances that caused the Drow dialect to diverge faster than possibly the surface dialects might have in the same period of time.  We just don't have enough data to say.</p><br /><p>Tom Costa once wrote an article for Dragon Magazine Annual #4 about Faerûnian linguistics and the language family tree called "Speaking in Tongues".  Don't recall if it included elven, but I think it addressed elven.  It was an awesome article, and I believe that Ed Greenwood endorsed it as canon.  Totally worth checking out.</p><br /><p>Tom's 2e language scheme was simplified for 3e, and a lot of the dialects and local languages were eliminated or absorbed for the 3e set of languages (as published in the 3e Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide) which were further simplified for 4e.</p><br /><p>There is also a lot of linguistic information peppered throughout the book <i>Races of Faerûn</i>, which is also a fantastic reference for lore--highly recommended.</p><br /><p>The sad thing is that gaming logistics don't deal well with a realistic treatment of linguistics and dialects.  Gaming considerations prefer a limited number of languages, or to ignore languages altogether, whereas world-building considerations prefer a multitude of languages and dialects, history, writing systems, etc.  These two considerations are in a constant tug-of-war.  Linguistics thus often get short shrift in the published lore, which is a shame but understandable given its limited appeal and utility to a role-playing environment.</p><br /><p>I haven't gone through the elven netbook that they have been assembling on the boards, yet, but it may also have some nice elven language lore for you to check out.</p><br /><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#138</p>The_Silversword</p>Oct 31, 2009 19:17:43 </td><td valign = "top"><p>Thank you Gray Richardson for that detailed response!

I myself was wondering WHAT TO DO WITH THE 1e-2e version of the Elven font, I hate retconning things and just saying well the 3e one is the one that they always use. My thought that perhaps the original Realms Elven script, was the actual Elven, where as the 3e one is Eldarin which has since been adopted by the Elves as well. Or perhaps the older script was used by the Elves to communicate with humans as they figured the actual Elven script was too complex for the humans and other races?

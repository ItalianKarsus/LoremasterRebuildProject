It could of happened in one of the novels. Im not a big reader of the novels, I spent most of my money on the sourcebooks. Thats one of my beefs with the new edition, no new sourcebooks!!! I guess if I want more 4e Realms lore i HAVE to read the novels. They really need to put out a gazetter or something, Eventually theyll have after they have so many novels out, theyll have to update the game side of things to reflect changes and the advancing timeline from the novels.<br /><br />But any way the Stayrm Moonblade in the hands of a Vampire Bladesinger sounds like an awesome idea!!!!</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#23</p>Imruphel</p>Jan 20, 2010 20:25:12 </td><td valign = "top"><blockquote> (snip) I am/was planning on using Blackmoon as the leader of the Eldreth Veluuthra.   As I giggle with malicious glee at the thought of their expressions should they ever come to realize that one of their foes is none other than....a sword.</blockquote><br /><br /><br />I really like that. I have been planning a campaign that will involve the Eldreth Veluuthra as recurring foes and was thinking about including Moander and the <i>Starym Moonblade</i> as well. I think I will just steal your idea!<br /><br /><blockquote> (snip) That's one of my beefs with the new edition, no new sourcebooks!!!

What I have been doing is going back through some of the old stuff, particularly as relates to the elves, and trying to work out what that means <i>today</i> and then trying to craft my own lore that uses the existing lore as a foundation. Some may say that I'm putting in too much effort but this is my way to relax! ;)<br /></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#24</p>sfdragon</p>Jan 20, 2010 21:28:48 </td><td valign = "top">+2</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#25</p>The_Silversword</p>Jan 20, 2010 22:53:55 </td><td valign = "top">Agreed!

Anyway, I was thinking about having some drow near Loudwater and I decided to grab these comments and establish an enclave of Malkizid-worshipping drow in the Grey Peaks (away from my books- the mountains southeast-ish of Loudwater) and now I'm thinking about tying them into Hellgate Keep... which also means looking at all the great unique magic items from 2E's <i>Hellgate Keep</i> adventure and thinking about how they would fit into 4E and the post-Spellplague world.<br /><br />Good fun!</td></tr></table></body></html>

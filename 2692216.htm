And it should be noted that it was (almost) never so pure that town councils wouldn't exist, and that oligarchy is a pretty good description of many/most city states in medieval Europe, and for that matter outside western Europe (consider Novgord, for example). Huge portions of the realms, including places like Thay which don't superficially look that way, fit a generally 'feudal' model in economic terms.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#7</p>Stigger</p>Jun 22, 2010 5:29:25 </td><td valign = "top">Sure, but an economic system that doesn't really fit into Faerun as far as I can tell.  Certainly aren't many serfs working the land for their owners that I've ever seen mentioned.  Beyond that, the notion of manorialism, heavily associated with the concept of feudal economics, if not somewhat synonomous with it, certainly doesn't work well with a world with well-established trade land- and sea-routes that are international in nature.  And it definitely doesn't work with a rising middle class of merchants who begin to dominate economics, which is decidedly the case with Faerun, much less a heavily armed class of adventurers who don't necessarily owe fealty to any given lord or flag but their own.  Maybe if you use a very vague definition of feudalism it might work, but even then, the term carries too much political and social baggage to be correctly applied I think.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#8</p>meldread</p>Jun 22, 2010 8:37:52 </td><td valign = "top"><p style="margin-bottom:0in">I don't think there is any direct analog to compare the Realms to the real world in terms of economics.

However, while portals are somewhat plentiful to the point of being absurd they are often for personal use, in an inconvenient location, or in some area that is hostile.  On top of that there are sometimes persnickety conditions to worry about.  Magic certainly throws a wrench in any number of things when it comes to thinking about real world economics.<br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">It is perfectly conceivable that with magic, especially a high magic world such as Toril, that they would experience an economic revolution that would make the industrial and information age - combined - look pathetic and paltry.</p><br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">On the other hand, we know this is not how things have unfolded.  You do not see portals being exploited in such a way on a large scale, magical golems that produce masterwork craftsmanship consistently, around the clock and throughout the year, etc.  Any number of things could be done with magic that could effectively give the people of Toril everything we enjoy in our modern world plus more.</p><br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">However, everything we know about the economy and people of Toril does not agree with that assessment.  It has been... overlooked, in a large degree, because it doesn't fit the desired flavor for the setting.  It is only a problem if players want to do something like this, and of course want the answer to the question:  Why hasn't anyone else thought of this or done it?  It's also a problem for a DM who demands that the logic of the setting match up with the logic of the rules.</p><br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">To my knowledge, Eberron is the only WotC campaign setting that actively tried to reconcile the rules with the setting.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#10</p>suin_bahhar_02</p>Jun 22, 2010 18:39:25 </td><td valign = "top">Portals in FR where generally well kept secrets by those who owned them, so their commercial use was mostly limited to clandestine smuggling (though Aurora's trading company held a small portal system for delivery of goods I believe). Those mercantile companies that managed to build portals where usually spending lots of resources on its defence and had to constantly stave off people with more arcane expertise with entirely different intended uses for the portal network. I think it was such a group, the Twisted Rune, that held most of western Fearuns portals in their possesion.<br /><br />So the consensus is that the existing limits on economic growth (roads throughs dangerous frontiers, social immobility and lack of organised specialistic artisanry) is hampering a larger move towards increasing subsistance levels through integrated magic and technology in the 15th century realms? Perhaps the suppression of organised artisanry is to be blamed, and I can see several candidates amongst the multitude of organisations doing just that. Sharrans or Talosians sabotaging just for the anguish and awe it would bring them, Siamorphe clerics banning the practise of large scale mercantile ventures, or rival factions amongs the Gondarkites claiming certain practises as unfaithfull....<br /></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#11</p>Stigger</p>Jun 23, 2010 1:42:54 </td><td valign = "top">Only thing I'd tend to take exception with there Meldread is the social stratification thing you mentioned.  There seemed to be a fairly fluid social mobility going on in the Realms.  Just the existance of adventurers implies such... the fact that anyone can even own property who isn't a noble says that, as do a lot of other small little bits mentioned here and there throughout the Volo's Guides.  There's plenty of evidence of social movement between lower, middle, and upper classes in those guides, and other sources as well, both 2e and 3e.  I don't argue that there's a definite distinction between them, but things like valor, merit, marriage, wealth, and just dumb luck (<span style="color:#888888">the catchall for stuff adventurers can get up to</span>) can move you between those layers.  You may not be accepted by other members of those classes as truly equal to them, but that's more a question of social acceptance, not societal social rank.  You maybe lesser to the old guard, but to the average commoner, and more importantly to the government, you're still upper (<span style="color:#888888">or middle</span>) class.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#12</p>Bluenose</p>Jun 23, 2010 4:34:17 </td><td valign = "top"><blockquote><br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">I don't think there is any direct analog to compare the Realms to the real world in terms of economics.  However, I think some basic things hold true.</p><br /><br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">-  There is no hint of industrialization in Faerûn.</p><br /><br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">-  Because of this there is no mass production, and the artisan is the source of all manufactured goods.</p><br /><br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">-  The vast majority of Faerûn lives in rural areas, not in cities.</p><br /><br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">-  Agriculture forms the backbone of most major economies.</p><br /><br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">-  Specialization when it comes to crafts tend to be limited, the local blacksmith not only repairs your weapon and armor, but also creates horseshoes, and common metal utensils used around the home.</p><br /><br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">-  Social classes are fairly stratified, with political and social mobility based upon three things (generally):   ability / talent (adventurers), wealth (merchant class), or birth (nobles or those born into wealth).</p><br /><br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">-  Few people have the opportunity to see or hear beyond their own village.  Word most commonly travels by those who use the various trading routes.</p><br /><br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">This would easily characterize the bulk of Faerûn.  It begins to relax once you head into the cities.  Although the major changes there are largely limited to artisans becoming more specialized and social mobility becoming slightly more relaxed.</p><br /><br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">As a general rule I would classify most nations as embracing some form of enlightened mercantilism, but only loosely.</p><br /><br /><p style="margin-bottom:0in">Most artisans learn their trade through apprenticeship.</p></blockquote><br /><br /><br />I don't disagree with most of this, though I think social stratification isn't particularly pronounced. Though of course there are arguments that it wasn't really as pronounced historically, particularly outside medieval western Europe .

At least one Italian condottiere (Piccolomini, possibly) went from common soldier to Count, and outside western Europe there are much more spectacular examples - Timur perhaps is best known. What I'd suggest is the Realms show a sort of social mobility that is more common towards the end of the middle ages and/or in cultures that never were all that stratified.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#13</p>Stigger</p>Jun 23, 2010 5:59:50 </td><td valign = "top">While I don't want to speak for Meldread, I'd say the enlightened mercantalism was a good call.  Most nations and city states have a distinct and professional merchant class, with a definite bias towards centering their economies around those merchants, rather than around the agrarian pursuits that one might expect in a non-merchant driven soceity.  If one wants to take it a step further, given the mercantile pursuits that most (broadly speaking) of the nobility seems to indulge in, I'd say it makes an even stronger case.  Its not like there's the Churches prohibition towards the evils of coin (<span style="color:#888888">ironic considering their ownership of so many brothels, but the Church has never been short on irony</span>) and the static nature of land ownership that Europe had to contend with.<br /><br />As to the historic occurance of social mobility, it certainly did happen, but it was the noteworthy exception, rather than the rule, at least as far as I'm aware.  As to a condottiere, as I recall those were essentially mercenaries who worked for the Church, and as I'm sure you're aware, the Church played by different rules than the rest of the world.<br /><br />Speaking of churches, that's another area of social mobility that is hard to overstate the difference of.  Historically, you had to be a third or fourth born noble to have much hope of ever rising within the Church heirarchy, and it was considered a perfectly good, and even desireable vocation to follow.  On Faerun however... the gods seem to pick their own clergy, at least as far as actual clerics go, which is a rather large and important diversion.<br /><br />The role of gender is another issue where you have whole other issues of social mobility and such compared to Europe's cultures.  Certainly there was a lot more egalatarianism than one is led to believe, but in a legal sense, and a rights sense, you were pretty much screwed if you were born a woman, with another irony being that the commoner woman generally had much more freedom than did their noble born counterparts.<br /><br />Really, if you think about it, Faerun is considerably more socially progressive than even modern Earth has managed to achieve in a lot of respects, at least the 2e version of the Realms was, though that seemed to be declining a bit in 3e in some respects.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#14</p>meldread</p>Jun 24, 2010 2:57:07 </td><td valign = "top"><p style="margin-bottom:0in">Stigger largely summed up what I meant by enlightened mercantilism.

I think for the post-Spellplague Realms, steampunk-ish themes are appropriate and a great idea. <br /><br />So long as a DM perceives that his or her players won't object to it (or think it "wrong" for the Realms), I say go for it. Heck, even if one or two players do squawck about it, just tell 'em it's been one hundred damn years. Priorities change when things go haywire with magic.<br /><br />Given time with this theme, I would use Maxer Hlaar's creations as the starting point for an organization or business, based in Suzail, that sells magical constructs. Their motto: "Things made of gears will always rust. Our magical constructs are the kind you can trust!"<br /><br />This group would compete fiercely with another organization that sells constructs out of the Sword Coast....say a group who recovered lost Lantanese (Lantanar?) relics from beneath the ocean and are using them as a template to build steampunk-type devices. Their motto: "Don't rely on fickle magic! The next time it fails your losses will be tragic!"<br /><br />The irony would be that the Sword Coast group will have used one of Maxer's treasure finding constructs to unearth and recover all the Lantan-created devices they now base their own creations on, and they're still using it to this day.<br /><br />The Suzail group wants that construct back and are willing to charter adventurers to "bring back the rightful property of Maxer and Cormyr".</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#17</p>Jorunhast</p>Jul 04, 2010 10:13:00 </td><td valign = "top"><blockquote>I think for the post-Spellplague Realms, steampunk-ish themes are appropriate and a great idea...</blockquote><br /><br />This made me wonder, with Mystra's murder are there still restrictions on gun powder?  I always thought it was odd to get rid of gunpowder and then come up with a half-magic functional equivalent.<br /><br />And did Lantan get wiped out by the Spellplague or something else?  If so, that's a shame.  How can people not love those little artificer gnomes?  They're cute and they make explosives.  Win-win!<br /></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#18</p>suin_bahhar_02</p>Jul 04, 2010 18:11:35 </td><td valign = "top">Maxer Hlaar...

Maxer was a mage who defended Cormyr from dragon attack and was awarded the title Defender of Suzail (equivalent in rank to a Baron amongst both the Purple Dragons and the nobility). <br /><br />He was an 11th level Invoker (in 2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons terms) who led a very private life, slowly amassing an arsenal of magical weaponry culled and collected by his semi-sentient constructs from the (then) ruins of Myth Drannor, the tombs of liches and a drowned city of sorcerers off of Athkatla.<br /><br />See Volo's Guide to Cormyr, page 221.<br /><br /><blockquote>What happened to Gond anyway? If the Lantanese got scoured like so he would have intervened on the gnomes behalf in <em>some</em> way. <br /></blockquote><br />
I quite agree about the gnomes being saved in some way. The Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide is pretty blunt in saying, <em>"All its machines, its technology, and its people were drowned. The land is much reduced in area, and its clockwork marvels lie rusting below the waves."</em><br /><br />But, like so much else in the Realms over the years, we can treat this bit of information as not nearly as absolute as it seems. Which is to say now that we know the lore, we can "fix" it. <br /><br />The last sentence about the much reduced in area "Lantan's Rest" says, <em>"The pirates of Nelanther say a monster sinks any ship that draws near". <br /></em><br />What this says to me is Gond created a clockwork marvel...something big enough to save the people of Lantan and the greatest of their works. Now the gnomes ply the ocean depths in this ocean-going device, slowly scouring the surface below the waves for all their lost marvels and driving off any would-be thieves they discover. <br /><br />To everyone else, the first bit about Lantan being washed away is "true" as far as anyone cares to know or find out. Only the pirates of Nelanther have the barest hint of a clue that this is not the case.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#21</p>Stigger</p>Jul 05, 2010 2:17:14 </td><td valign = "top">Interesting take on Lantan there Misc.  Not bad at all.  Might have to incorporate that a little into my current 1337 campaign.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#22</p>meldread</p>Jul 05, 2010 9:26:55 </td><td valign = "top"><p>I say Lantan still exists.  There is now a sprawling domed metropolis below the waves.  Down there are half-gnome, half-machines that work tirelessly in their clockwork city of marvels away from the prying eyes of those upon the surface.  They are just waiting for the day when their master machine will be complete, raising their city-below-the-waves into the clouds.  <img src="http://community.wizards.com/tools/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-tongue-out.gif" alt="Tongue out" title="Tongue out" border="0" /></p><br /><p>Click-whirl-click-ZZZZ that will be the sound of your doom!</p><br /><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#23</p>Jorunhast</p>Jul 05, 2010 9:46:41 </td><td valign = "top"><blockquote>...The last sentence about the much reduced in area "Lantan's Rest" says, <em>"The pirates of Nelanther say a monster sinks any ship that draws near". <br /></em><br />What this says to me is Gond created a clockwork marvel...something big enough to save the people of Lantan and the greatest of their works.

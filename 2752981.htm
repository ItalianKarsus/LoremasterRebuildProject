It was my understanding that the reason Neverwinter was never really developed much in previous editions was that it (and Baldur's Gate for that matter) were set aside as rather 'vague' locations specifically to allow the computer games to develop things there.

But after thinking about it some, and remembering that the 4e FRCG said that Neverwinter was in ruins, Im interested to see where they are going with this, and its bound to have a Neverwinter map, which is something that theyve never done, aside from the video game.

It could be another variant swordmage build, but with a different name. Essentials have classes with new names - like slayer/knight that have different mechanics to their core class. Bladesinger can be its own class, while still having ties to the swordmage in a post-essentials world. This also means it can be mechanically different as well.<br /><br /><blockquote>As for those 'arbitrary and silly restrictions' as you call them...I call them depth.</blockquote><br />
You would.  <br /><blockquote>If you don't like them then you really never had to use them.</blockquote><br />
At the same time, if you like them you're welcome to add all the silly and completely nonsensical restrictions you like. <br /><blockquote>But having them creates interesting lore</blockquote><br />
Not really.<br /><blockquote>and if you choose to relax them actualy make the PC exceptional instead of just like everyone else.</blockquote><br />
Protip: You don't need mechanics to do this. You can write the lore as it is, but the actual mechanics don't need to reflect this at all. Dragonmarks in Eberron are usually bloodline related, but their mechanics don't require them to have to be taken by certain races. The games lore is still the same as third edition, proving that you don't require this at all for either lore or that a PC will be exceptional. By lore in Eberron, a Warforged with a mark is absolutely exceptional - the mechanics don't have to make a restriction for this to still be the case.<br /><br />The exception of course would be if they made Bladesinger a racial PP. But a class that can be used by a whopping two races isn't one that is likely to see publication in 4E. So it might have lore and fluff that supports it as a class for Elves/Half-Elves, but a mechanical restriction isn't going to happen. You can do that in your game if you like, I prefer to take a better approach in make the world react to it appropriately - not arbitrarily pretend it never happens through mechanics. Alternatively, they may even change the fluff so it isn't a class that is so restricted either and may have spread to other races. Until we see it we don't know.<br /><blockquote>And we are talking about the Bladesinger class which has been restricted to elves and half elves since the elves first created this path.</blockquote><br />
Mark of Storm in Eberron is restricted to half-elves by lore and fluff, but mechanically it isn't restricted at all. Expecting them to start doing this for other things is not going to be the case. <br /><blockquote>So are you going to tell me that it is ok to not even mention these restriction?</blockquote><br />
You're welcome to be entirely wrong, but it's not going to happen if Wizards still has common sense behind how they design 4E in leaving restrictions up to the DM. Dark Sun and the Dragonmarks of Eberron are good examples of their approach, which works extremely well.<br /></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#58</p>The_Silversword</p>Aug 08, 2010 3:02:52 </td><td valign = "top">Well Im definitely stoked about it.

In your opinion, but this is something the DM decides and as such there is no requirement for a racial restriction. If you've read the actual 4E Eberron books they explain the logic behind why this was done perfectly. It is not required.<br /><blockquote>Why can't humans take the feat Tieflings can called prehensile tail...I  mean heck there are humans born in the real world with tails?</blockquote><br />
I have no problem with racial feats and humans with tails born in the real world are vestigial and aren't prehensile. The point was things like classes and similar, or world related feats like dragonmarks. Most of the time, I see dragonmarks on the same race anyway as they should be - but not always. The book doesn't need to enforce this, PCs and me (the DM) can do that more than adequately.<br /><blockquote>I mean for every racial restriction there was lore behind it...it was  not arbitary or silly(in most cases granted there was some sillyness in  some of it...but most of those were actualy fixed in 3rd).</blockquote><br />
When I think of racial restrictions, I usually think about 2nd edition actually. 3rd edition removed this and 4E took the most logical step and completely annihilated it. A good evolution.<br /><blockquote>Did TSR send stormtroopers to stop DMs from lifting these restriction...not that I am aware of...</blockquote><br />
Equally, what stops a DM from enforcing it if they feel like it? Absolutely nothing. You can write lore, but you don't need mechanics to support it because the DM can decide that. Eberron proved to me that was one of the best ways of doing things. Make sure the lore emphasizes who can take it and why, then leave it to the DM to decide. </td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#62</p>pamela</p>Aug 08, 2010 8:24:53 </td><td valign = "top"><a href="http://thetome.podbean.com/" rel="nofollow">The Tome Show</a> has three podcasts related to yesterday's WotC Preview as well as the FR Panel, all on August 7th.

Many of the deities over-lapped in various areas and seemed shore-horned into the setting IMO. I for one don't need to see each race (and sub-race) have a multitude of deities that share one or more common elements with other Gods from differen't pantheons. It gets to a point where Deities lose what makes them unique. Do Drow really need 5 (yes 5!) different Gods to pray to??! I could easily do with just Lloth and Elistraee and be done with it. <br /><br />The fact that they're bringing back Helm isn't something I honestly like seeing as he was yet another deity with over-lapping portfolilos and who's niche in the Realms is already taken up by Torm and Bahamut. Its not that I don't like Helm (I have at least two characters who worship him), but I feel he really doesn't have a place in a 1479 DR Faerun. <br /><br /><br /><blockquote>So I hear they are bringing back Mystra...Helm...maybe Tyr...(I still think Torm would make a great villian) , Now if they bring back the racial pantheons...Elistraee...Vhar...er...her brother I can't spell his name...and send Abier back....maybe we can start making the Realms...to use how they speak...'Cool' again...and 'Awesome'...oh yeah get rid of Dragonborn....and make Tieflings what they once were...ok maybe asking too much here...lets start the road to recovery slowly....sigh I know this will never happen.</blockquote><br /><br /><br />I'd probably puke if they brought back Mystra. Killing her off was pretty much the MAIN reason we had the Spell-plague and changes to magic (which apparently were needed for 4E mechanics) in the first place. Sure, they really didn't need to kill her off but it was an easy choice to qualm the people who disliked the Realms Justice League (ie. all of the immaculate Chosen) and lay to rest a deity which had zero continunity in the way her character reflected her supposed LN alignment in addition to her stability as a deity (she died what 3 times now?!).  <br /><br />I've already mentioned my POV on Helm but bringing Tyr back would be a mistake too. First, he wasn't even pure "Realmsian" to begin with and second, it wouldn't make much sense for the designers to go through all the hoop-la with bringing Ilmater back to Celestia and Bahamut from the Minors with Torm leading the show JUST to have Tyr come back and re-claim it all and retake the throne. It's even more stupid than the stupid love-betrayal triangle which got Tyr and Helm killed to begin with. When you make a stupid mistake, you don't go and make ANOTHER stupid mistake to try to fix the first stupid mistake. It just makes it look like a sloppy mess. <br /><br />As for Abier, I don't think it's all that much of a problem anymore. It more or less just "fused" with the backround for the setting and made some (albiet drastic) changes in certain places but any DM can put as little or much emphasis on it's existance as they wish. I've been doing 4eFR for over 2 years now and it's never come up in the campaign or genereal conversation with the local populace or my PCs. <br /><br />As far as Dragonborn are concerned, their existance is easily placed in the Realms prior to Abier coming into contact with Toril. Easily re-name them to Dragon-kin and *pop* there ya go. I for one didn't feel their existance needed to be explained in such a dramtic way as the designers went where a simple name change (like Devas sometimes being called Aasimar) would've sufficed. <br /><br />And as for Tieflings, besides their "appearence" (which BTW could be changed any-which-way a person wants) what has changed with them since 4E? If anything, they've been brought in-line with the other races for more options as a PC race and fleshed out more so than any previous <br />edition. Would you like them to go back to being just a monster with no ecology?<br /><br />"Rant over" you may go back about your buisness.<br /><br />P.S. - Glad to see their putting out more info and supplements in Book form. Can't wait for the next years line-up. And thanks to those for keeping us posted.  </td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#89</p>gomeztoo</p>Aug 09, 2010 10:00:49 </td><td valign = "top">I actually doubt they will bring Helm back, other than the splinter faith (which really worship Torm as Helm's successor) that was introduced in Downshadow.<br />I also doubt Mystra will be back (at least as a goddess).</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#90</p>sfdragon</p>Aug 09, 2010 12:22:30 </td><td valign = "top">they could bring thme back...

Well, being featured is not the same as being back. There was a recent DDI article about some heretical torm worshipers worshiping Torm as the three-in-one triad of Helm/Tyr/Torm merged and using a holy symbol that's an amalgam of all three.

They're removed enough from surface elves in their lookout that the Seldarine are not in general a good fit, and Lolth by no means fills the religious needs of all drow.

Eilistraee is a supposedly goody-two-shoes matriarchy that's actually more strict in that religiously than Lolth. Wanna be a male priest of Lolth? OK, she'll allow it for gits and shiggles, but you won't get far and you're going to have to watch your back constantly. Male priest of Eilistraee? Come back after you've had a sex change. Then maybe.</p><br /><p>Vhaeraun, then, actually fills a gap - Males. He's the only one who really gives males a fair shake. He reverses the matriarchy to a patriarchy, sure, but if you're a male drow, it's a good gig for you, isn't it? And there are still a few females even there, with a fairly special role.</p><br /><p>Kiaransalee and Ghaunadaur are somewhat more extraneous; there's room for them, but they're a bit of an odd thing.</p><br /><p>Selvetarm is something of an odd case due to his backstory, though it does generally give males another outlet with his faith rather than his father's, for those who aren't utterly opposed to Lolth.</p><br /><p>And we'll refrain from getting into the way the LP series handled killing nearly the entire pantheon and how terrible it was simply because I could go on for days.</p><br /><p>Anyway.

Dracolich's in a dramatic pose is always good. From what I've heard about the supplement it sounds pretty good actually.

It's done in the same style as all the other books. I have to wonder if this means it makes a lot of core world assumptions, adding Neverwinter into the core world and not being strictly designed for FR. This would explain why they are doing this with the previously stated 2 core books and an adventure per setting thing. It mean they can expand on FR while making something that will still be generally useful to players of the "core" world that doesn't use strictly FR assumptions. Unless the FR logo has been shoved off onto the spine of the book or something.

Then look at what their designed to do (ie Domains) and 3 out of possible 5 are exactly the same: Law, Protection, Strength. So one's ethos is more aligned towards protection and law while the other is geared towards loyalty and duty, which <em>sort of</em> coinside together to begin with. I like Helm but bringing him back isn't needed IMO.<br /><p></p><blockquote><br />3) Mystra and choosn made my campaign better...and also they wrote her and her choosen like morons.  That is the reason why I ignored the novels...because the authors plain out ignored what was written about them previously.  Also killing Mystra and the spellplague made me puke.</blockquote><br /><br /><p>Then why exactly is she LN then? Were there evil or quasi-evil characters who gained "Chosen" status too? I don't believe so. No, Mystra had her very "exclusive" crowd which only certain members were able to join. To me that didn't make them cool or special, it made me annoyed. <br /><br /></p><blockquote><br />4) Abier should have been it's own campaign world.  Heck it was but the designers didn't think it would sell on it's own so they lumped it intp the FR...alot of the 4th ED Realms idea was are like that...which is why they had to rewrite the history so they could see thei ideas published...which I don't mind but I think they could have fit it in better in my opinion.</blockquote><br /><br /><br />From my earlier experiences with <em>Magic: The Gathering, </em>merging world in catastrophic fashion was the norm, so it wasn't a far fetch for me. And Returned Abier can still be a campaign setting in it's own right. Hopefully with WotC publishing further Realms game supplements, we'll see this too. Also, the fact that the merging of Abier took out the places I despised most about the Realms made me happy, so I can't complain about it's inclusion. <br /><br /><blockquote><br />6) Also Tyr not being Realmsian...well neither are Silvanus...Mielikki...or Loviarar(the las two being taken from the Finnish Pantheon).  But I liked the idea of the whole interconnected planes...where gods can be worshipped on many different planets.  Again it creates great RP opportunity.</blockquote><br /><br /><br />I didn't know about the deities you mentioned being from other (Earth based) pantheons. But I'm not botherd by Silvanus or Loviatar because they're very distinctive and Silvanus is a Greater god. Mielikki I don't really care for and I"m happy she's been delegated to a Exarch status in 4E. <br /><br /><blockquote><br />7) Dragonborn...you are right...I just dislike players races that are Dragons.  and yes they can easily be redefined as half-dragons.</blockquote><br /><br /><br />I knew we'd agree on something <img border="0" src="http://community.wizards.com/tools/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-tongue-out.gif" alt="Tongue out" title="Tongue out" /><br /><br /><blockquote><br />8) Ok I have to say I completely disagree with you about Tieflings back in earlier editions of the games.  I have been playing them since I first could(which was Planescape in 2nd ed by the way).  I loved the fact that there was no racial unity...each Tiefling was unique in it's orgins...appearence...and powers(though in 3rd they simplfied it).  It made the race RP points alot of fun to deal with.  Actualy from what I gather from the creator's notes that I would have loved the 1st draft of the Tiefling(for 4th Ed.) which was more like the 2nd ed version.  But the races was never some 'monster with no ecology' to me atleast.<br /><br />My experience with 2e/AD&amp;D is very limited but in 3.x Tieflings weren't really expanded upon in many supplements and even as a PC race, didn't really appeal much to me. When they got rid of Level Adjustments for 4E and Tieflings became a major PC race, my interest for them grew 10-fold. The fact that they make good Paladins, Sorcerers, Warlocks, Rogues, Wizards, and a fighters just opens the door to possibilities and they have great feat support too. Their appearance (which to some seems bad, off, or stupid) can just as easily be written off in the character description. I don't see what the problem with them is Now compared to previous editions. <br /><br /><blockquote><br />Anyway don't consider this as a arguement...it is just the other side of your viewpoint.</blockquote><br /><br /><br />No, this isn't an argument at all. It's two people with different points of view talking about something they both have a passion for. It creates great discussion when two people don't share the same ideals but can talk about it in a calm fashion. *cheers*!</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#111</p>sfdragon</p>Aug 10, 2010 21:24:16 </td><td valign = "top">I thought Mielikki was a goddess and not an exarch</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#112</p>Dragon9</p>Aug 10, 2010 21:46:53 </td><td valign = "top">Yes, she is a goddess.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#113</p>Jorunhast</p>Aug 10, 2010 23:08:43 </td><td valign = "top"><blockquote>While I see there are connections in referece to the multitude of deities of our planet, I don't see the need to reflect those same ideas in a Fantasy campaign setting.

If you're going to do it, do it all the way or don't bother for the main campaign guides.</blockquote><br /><br /><br />Well unfortunaly I don't have time to go all the way...I mean if I did I would not need the FR.  Also what is needed is different for different people...Honestly I don't need Cyric...I don't need Torm...but I do need Mystra...I need Elistraee...I need the Racial Pantheons...I need the the Mulhondri pantheon...and well that area of the world.  I also need more ifo maehcanicaly for gods like Lliira...Sharess...Eldath...Elistraee.<br /><br />So I personaly I think I rather see a hundred gods even if I don't need then to use then a narrow list that does not include the gods I do need.  It is far easier to cut things out than to add it.  A example...I don't like Cyric...I say he does not exist.  Easy....I want to add in Elistraee back in as a goddess...I have to atleast from my own mind come up the in 4thed parlance a Divine feat for her( maybe one or two other) make sure they are balanced in a very delicately balanced system...and create a Paragon Path for her priests...and make sure it is balanced.(Yes I think all god should have these...one of the reasons why I dislike 4th ed so much is that they leave that out),  Which one is easier?<br /><br />I personaly think they have turned the FR into a terrible RPG setting...it is very limited...in which if you want to expand on it it takes alot of work on your part.  Don't get me wrong here...it could be a great fantasy novel setting...but I think they have really forgotten the gaming aspect of it. </td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#127</p>pamela</p>Aug 11, 2010 15:17:03 </td><td valign = "top">I think the issue with the deities might have a lot to do with the edition you know.

I like canon because it continues the story where the gaming supplement just can't (due mostly to lack of sourcebooks and DDi content). <br /><br />Now, I can see and understand Chris's view on a lot of why people hate the books being canon, and I definitly hate the fact that lore-lawyers ruin the appeal that canon can have and that RSEs are a pain the the butt, but I just don't let those aspect of lore affect my games and I urge other DMs not to feel constrained by lore and use it as a tool to further your Realms experiences.</blockquote><br /><br /><br />While I agree with you that novels were great in fleshing out the world.  Letting you have a insight into the cultures and such in the Realms...I think it sets a mind set in the designers and authors minds that is not conductive to a RPG setting.  It creates storys instead of history.  Now let me point to example of what I am getting at.<br /><br />They had the whole seris of books designed to narrow the drow pantheon to Lloth...why because they wanted to resolve that 'story'.  Also the Cyric assassinating Mystra...was done for the same reason.  To end the story.  The problem with this I don't want to read a novel when I am gaming...I want to feel that the world I am playing in is not some sort of movie or novel that I am esperiencing...I want to feel that I am playing a actrual character in a living world...where history does not end because of literature conventions.  Which is why I always believed that novels should not be cannon...because to me atleast it is the antithesis of a RPG.  You can get the peak into cultures without the novels being cannon.<br /><br />Also here is another reason why I think it is...not a good idea from a bussiness prospective.  I mean even if I thought 4th ed was the greatest game ever created by people...with the changes they did the Realms...and what has happened in my game...I can't think of a single reason why I would ever need to but into 4th ed FR...it is completely the opposite of what happens in my ongoing game world.  The Spellplague won't and can't happen in my FR...Abier was just a name...Cyric got killed...Mystra reverted to her duties of keeping the balance...etc.  These are thing that my PC have archieves so not only is it i just find the changes very heavy handed and just badly thought out...it would be a insult to my players to go with what happens in 4th ed.<br /><br />So it put  me...and others like me in a position of saying to ourselves...what is the point in buying the 4th ed Realms...for what maybe a handful of interesting ideas you can convert back into the Classic FR...it is not worth the money.  Which I think...makes the setting very much non-viable...heck the only reason I think you guys are getting the Neverwinter soucebook is because of two reasons:<br /><br />1) I think they are running out of ideas to publish things for 4th ed...and we might see a souce book for Eberron and Dark Sun detailing a city. <br /><br />2) Because you guys are passionate fans that it is sorta hard to ignore.<br /><br />Anyway just my two coppers.</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#149</p>Stigger</p>Aug 12, 2010 16:02:29 </td><td valign = "top"><blockquote>Whereas I would prefer to see that "sacredness" educated out of them and for the novels to be left alone. It is an unhealthy attitude to have in pretty much any RPG game, why stand for it? In a game based on an LFR module, the first time I piped up on a tangential subject (not challenging or lore-lawyering, just a query) the group had a nice chat about the difference between WotC canon and my DM's canon, and there hasn't been an issue since with any of our players. As I said in my "Canon Fodder" post, we aren't special in any way, how has this become enough of a problem that people want the novels de-canonised over it? And can it not be sorted out with a frank discussion between players and DM?</blockquote><br /><br /><br />I think my largest problem isn't that it intrudes into the game for me (<span style="color:#888888">it doesn't, not at all, as none of us bother with very many novels in the first place</span>), but that it advances the world in ways I never would, and that means I have to sort out the mess that novels make from various sourcebooks and such.  Take that nonsense with the canal... or the war with Iakhovas... or that melodramatic Sembian nonsense... or the garbage with Reborn Netheril.  Absolutely none of that would every find its way into any game I ever ran.  Personally, I find a lot of the ideas half-baked, half-cocked, and just plain stupid.  Note that I don't necessarily blame the authors for all of this... very little of it actually, they're just following orders when it comes down to it.<br /><br />Even with cultures, I find them less than useful, as a lot of them interject some pretty modern nonsense into the works, with attitudes and mores that just don't work in my head.  Either that or they borrow from garbled real-world analogs that tend to fall flat for me.<br /><br />Given the choice, I'd be much happier with things if the novels focused on small things that were apocryphal and non-canon, rather than events that significantly changed things.  Which is why I particularly enjoyed Mel Odom's <em><strong>Lost Library of Cormanthyr</strong></em>, as it introduced some interesting characters, tossed out some nifty ideas and locales, and yet changed pretty much nothing in the campaign setting when it came down to it.  That and it had an azmyth in it, which are always good.  Which is pretty much why I hated the Cormyr trilogy.  I'd have been much happier with the idea of the 3e FRCS telling us that Azoun IV &amp; Tanalasta had died, without telling us how or why, and that Alusair had taken the throne as regent for Azoun V than with the whole thing spelled out for us in such a way that made me want to pull my hair out from annoyance when I read it.<br /><br />I guess when it comes down to it, I'd prefer interesting little details over grandly sweeping alterations and events.  Probably why I've avoided the novels for the most part all these years (<span style="color:#888888">that and a lot of them just plain don't interest me</span>).</td></tr><tr><td valign = "top">#150</p>Aegeri</p>Aug 13, 2010 22:40:51 </td><td valign = "top"><blockquote>It's going to be a book.</blockquote><br />
I actually find that oddly disappointing.<br /><blockquote><blockquote> Because they provide definitive canon answers. So it's  not up to the DM to decide. The novels do and the DM decides if the  novels are right or not. The movement of the question being answered is  in fact a key and very important distinction between these two  concepts.</blockquote><br /><br /><br />On that basis, anything covered in novel or sourcebook could  prevent a problem. It isn't just confined to novels. What about the 3rd  person-omniscient view presented by the FRCS in 3E? That is likely to be  read by players too. Any source that sets out to talk about a subject  might impose something that could provide the same problem be it in the  Dragon or Dungeon magazines, the FRPG or the novels. All of the above  cause the same issue, <em>that</em> is why I failed to see the reason for singling out the novels.</blockquote><br /><br /><br />I don't mind this so much. I can interpret my way around what the book says if it leaves enough in the dark. It's when your dark parts are suddenly illuminated that is the problem - this is what an evolving metaplot does to a setting. A setting in state X is fine, a setting that is in state Y due to things outside the setting is not. Also 4E doesn't have a preponderance of sourcebooks for its settings. So sourcebooks screwing around with canon is a non-issue.

I wanted to come in and address a couple points, mostly related to the NWCG, and a little to my writing, and to canon fiction in general:<br /><br />
1) The three primary authors on the Neverwinter Campaign Guide are Matthew Sernett, Ari Marmell, and myself (Erik Scott de Bie). Not to speak for either of them, but I for one had a LOT of input into the book (I wrote a third or more of it). There may have been (or may eventually be) other people involved--if so, they have not been announced yet.<br /><br />
2) The NWCG will be something a little different from anything released in the Realms before. Can't say much else other than, I hope you'll like it, that you'll find uses for it in *any* FR game (not just one set in Neverwinter), and that you'll enjoy the acres and acres of story I and my fellow designers spent all that time crafting. I for one think it is (to quote NC quoting me) "awesometastic."<br /><br />
3) Whoever said I (or anyone else, for that matter) was bringing back Helm and in what form? I believe I said at the seminar that I *use* Helm, even though he's dead, and that if you want to read more about him, read more of my stuff . . . but I am *far* too fond of teasing to confirm or deny that there is any sort of plan to bring Helm back in any particular form. <br /><br />
4) Related to #3: Rest assured that if that *does* happen, and I *do* bring Helm back, it will be in a way that makes sense and fills a genuine need in the setting. (So all you folks who are saying "Helm doesn't have a place in 4e FR anymore," take a load off.) For more on the subject, read my next novel, Shadowbane (Sept 2011).<br /><br />

1) Some, and the design team made a distinct effort to put in stuff from the original NWN games. I for one put in a few things, some of which are subtle, some overt. And, well, 100 years have passed, in which some major events took place. Seeing how much can happen in the span of just a few years (2e to 3e, or even just in the scope of the NWN games), it's fair to say some things will be different. For precise details, you'll have to see the actual product.<br /><br />
2) I was incredibly excited, and glad to see the return to print products. <br /><br />
3) My personal opinion probably isn't all that helpful (and I'm sure some will agree and some won't), but I think we've covered a heckuva lot, and that comes from a background steeped in Realms products of the past. That said, we *did* come up with a lot more that probably won't make it in due to space concerns, which I think is a really good sign. There may or may not be DDI support to cover stuff we couldn't put in.<br /><br />
I'm happy with how the book is turning out, and I think you guys will be too.<br /><br />

I saw in Dragon issue #91 El's stats for 1E, and in the boxed set lots of other interesting lores.</p><p>However, what has shocked me about AD&D are some exceedingly powerful…</p><p>(4) monsters back then that seem nigh invincible, so powerful that almost any attempt I can think of to translate these beings into later-edition versions would seem inappropriate as that would undoubtedly lead to a shrink in their capabilities. On top of my head, I recall…</p><p>(5) …solars, whose stats in 1E and 2E are, in a word, overpowered.</p><p>Though I believe that, in the Realms, no one (or nothing) rivals great mages like Elminster in might, but these beings seem to stand a good chance. …</p><p>(6) So my question is… getting rid of the divine aid accessible to some of the powerful mages, in terms of overall power, does a solar have a fighting chance against anyone of the most powerful mages in the Realms (yeah, I know they're good guys…)?</p><p>Sincerely thanks.</p><p></p><p>1)</p><p>Certainly they have a chance. Solars are of course the D&D version of one tier of angels. I had no hand at all in designing them (they’re “outer planar,” not “Realms”), but the overpowered aspect is due to differing design philosophies among D&D game editions.</p><p>#realmslore</p><p>2)</p><p>In early editions of the game, there were beings who were supposed to be “too powerful” for PCs to defeat; just “out of mortal league.” Later game editions shifted to: gods have stats so your PCs can kill them and take their places.</p><p>#realmslore</p><p>3)</p><p>So some of my early monsters (and a lot of deities designed by many folks) are “gross” in power level. That was deliberate: DON’T mess with these beings through combat. Negotiate or die. Whereas later on it became: PCs can do anything.</p><p>#realmslore</p><p>4)</p><p>Just as Gary’s original D&D was: your PC is this one class, the class has strengths and grave weaknesses, too, so for success you MUST band together in a party and co-operate.

(iv)</p><p>Again, the best answer is “it depends.” On the location (city? trackless wilderlands?

Things that crunch are rarities.</p><p>Edible fungi cover a broad range of colours (though dun-browns to darker browns predominate, with purple being the next most popular—and never attempt to eat any fungi that look green) and shapes, from flaky spikes and “ledges” to shelf fungi, spears like asparagus, and various cap shapes with stalks, from tall and smooth to short and shaggy; literally just about everything.</p><p>These Underdark fungi offer flavours from salty or bitter and smoky to an almost vanilla-like sweetness; again, just about everything, including flavours that a blindfolded surface-dweller sampling them might mistake for roast beef or braised rothé.</p><p>Certain common fungi can be cooked to mush and then to an oil that thickens into a spreadable paste when taken off the heat, and this serves as a hummus-like “butter” (that can take on the flavour of herbs stirred into it, like garlic or dill into “real butter” derived from the milk of surface-dwelling creatures) when spread on other edibles. This is usually called “rarthree” by folk of the Underdark, regardless of species (though deep gnomes tend to shorten this to just “rarth” in casual speech).</p><p>The meat of the many edible lizards are often sliced into thin steaks and fried in rarthee, and tend to taste rather like real-world kangaroo meat; slightly gamier than boar or beef or rothé, but still striking the palate as “red meat” rather than fish or reptile. Pack lizards have the strongest taste, increasing with age and size, and Volo found it to be a curious cross between the fat of very well-marbled steaks, and bacon fat—without grease or the heaviness of fat.</p><p>Soups in the Underdark tend to all be thick enough to be called “stews” on the surface world, with diced chunks of meat or fungi, and almost all of them use simmered, reduced fungi as a base. “Superior” soups include the blood of slain edible creatures, which enriches the flavour and thins the texture. Large root vegetables such as potatoes are almost unknown in Underdark cuisine, yet their blandness would cause them to be “shrug” curiosities, not highly-prized novelties, if sampled.</p><p></p><p></p><p>###</p><p>[392]</p><p>?__> .REPLY-TO-TWITTER.

I'm Max. I've been playing D&D with the same character for 7 years: Draco, a half-dragon, son of an elf and a metallic dragon. I've also been a DM for RPGs and I have a question: can half-dragons have children? It's a question asked by the character himself.</p><p>The Monster Manual states that:half-dragons are incapable of naturally producing offspring. But if they cannot have children, how could a wizard of draconic origin exist? Could he be the son of a half-dragon? Or only of a pure dragon? Or is it only possible through magic/rituals?</p><p>So, to reproduce, would that only be possible through magical or ritual means? Or even through adoption? In a stable union, could a half-dragon like my character have a child? Thank you for your attention, Ed!</p><p></p><p>Many half-dragons are sterile, hence what the MM says, but they CAN have children with the right mate. What USUALLY happens is that the resulting offspring are visually human, with some draconic hidden traits, or blood heritage that comes out later on, in THEIR offspring (or a generation on). It can be something as simple as resistance or even immunity to a particular sort of breath weapon (or natural or magical equivalent).</p><p>However, the great majority of half-dragons can't give birth to "new" half-dragons.</p><p></p><p></p><p>###</p><p>[404]</p><p>There's no Christmas in the Realms, but there is Simril.

How or why did the Sarrukh fall and run from the Khaasta? As I recall they didn't have any abilities. Just demonic allies? Even in defeat why does the Sarrukh fear the Khaasta?</p><p></p><p>The Sarrukh fear the Khaasta because Sess'innek had a scheme to physically transform Sarrukh (the only Sarrukh not destined to die as sacrifices to him!) into servitor lizards (some into the lizard equivalent of hounds or war wolves, some into a “pack lizard”/wagon-pulling-beast role). The transformation made the mind of the transformed Sarrukh unable to resist mental commands from any Khaasta—so no Sarrukh wanted to be anywhere near a Khaasta, for any reason, for fear of being instantly mind-controlled. (There was so much fearful misinformation among Sarrukh about this, that they didn’t know the mind control only “worked” after they’d been transformed; a belief spread that Sess'innek was altering Khaasta to be able to pre-emptively control the minds of nearby Sarrukh.) Hence the “running and hiding."</p><p></p><p>###</p><p>[554]</p><p>From what I understand, Ed Greenwood’s campaign never advanced into the Time of Troubles.

In response to it, id say:</p><p>Lets say that the mortal is deeply in love with the god(dess) and wishes to spend eternity with them. Theyd try their absolute best to be a great, caring lover and accept the deity for who they *are.* Just genuine love.</p><p></p><p>If the deity can trust that genuine love (or mind-read to make certain of it), then the love is likely to be a bright anchor for them, to renew their energy and zest for existence and reaffirm their reasons for doing what they do.</p><p>Now, how to keep that love eternal...</p><p></p><p>I see! Then lets say the man obtains immortality and has even greater love and desire for his divine beloved. How would the god(dess) react to this? What if the man isnt necessarily a devout worshipper of the deity but still respects their portfolio and tries to help them?</p><p></p><p>What happens then depends on the character/nature of the god/goddess: how insane or hurt or damaged they may already be (how much can they trust?). If they can accept an immortal ally, then you have glory.</p><p>Not necessarily the most exciting of stories, but real glory.</p><p></p><p>With the example i mentioned earlier (Eilistraee) who is pretty healthy and considerate, lets say that the now immortal human never tires of their divine love and is overall the same being as before their ascension. No godhood, though. Just an immortal man who loves his god fully</p><p></p><p>Then he would become a treasure above all else to the goddess. A trusted friend and perhaps sometime lover, someone to relax and talk with. Someone to share with. As was said in A COLLEGE OF MAGICS: "Glove to my hand. EVERYTHING."</p><p></p><p>I see. What about marriage? Would someone like Eilistraee be willing to marry her human love and spend eternity with him, as soulmates? Would she be willing to have a family with him, if theyre on the same page? Would she get bored of him after awhile and see him more as a friend</p><p></p><p>I'd say Eilistraee would want to marry and have a forever-soulmate. I see her as wanting to have a family, though she may want to see Lolth dealt with, first (to bring children into a brighter world).

Alchemy is a process of experimentation, refining, adjusting, and experimenting again to get closer and closer.</p><p>However, given the right ingredients and tools, someone used to precision, who has studied alchemy sufficiently, should be able to concoct, their first time out, a reasonably powerful antiseptic, and an antidote that can treat symptoms (such as seizures, swellings, impaired vision or other senses).

It runs from Luskan in the north all the way to (depending on time period/edition) Amn or Tethyr or Calimport in the south.</p><p></p><p>There shouldn't be a gap in it.</p><p></p><p>It's not clear how the gap got on the 1E map, but I long assumed that this passage was responsible: https://t.co/wKagJx2LyB</p><p>?__>"Not considered safe" and "devastated" apparently got interpreted to mean that the road had been wiped out.</p><p></p><p>But, in point of fact, the road was not actually destroyed and the very next paragraph in the book describes how an army was raised and Dragonspear Castle was sacked.</p><p>?__>(It turns out this is not why the gap exists. See below).</p><p>?__>Another question is what happens between Scornubel and Baldur's Gate.</p><p></p><p>For a long time, I assumed (based on the map) that  the Trade Way actually WAS interrupted here: Trade would come down the road to Scornubel and then take the river to Baldur's Gate before heading south. https://t.co/qr610iAAIA</p><p>?__>This turns out not to be the case: The Trade Way has always entered Baldur's Gate via the city's north gate.</p><p></p><p>This would imply that a road must run from Scornubel to Baldur's Gate following the River Chionthar (and various snippets of text support this).</p><p>?__>But here's the odd thing: Elturel is NEVER described as being on the Trade Way, despite the fact that logically it would pass right through the city. </p><p></p><p>In fact, it EXPLICITLY doesn't: https://t.co/FXdeR19HCy</p><p>?__>We'll come back to this. For now, let's go back to the obvious mistake of the missing road between Dragonspear and Soubar. Easy to fix, right?</p><p></p><p>And it was.</p><p></p><p>I believe the next map produced was for the Forgotten Realms Atlas, and you can see that the road appears there: https://t.co/lLOYeCirD5</p><p>?__>But there are a couple problems:</p><p></p><p>(1) There's still no road between Elturel and Scornubel, so how does the Trade Way get from Scornubel to Baldur's Gate?</p><p></p><p>(2) There's a new road that cuts south directly from Dragonspear to Baldur's Gate. Why isn't THIS used as the Trade Way?</p><p>?__>In fact, on the map it's shown as a more significant road than the one leading to Soubar.</p><p></p><p>Let's move forward into 2nd Edition.</p><p></p><p>At some point this map was produced (it's all over the 'net claiming to be from the revised boxed set), but I can't figure out its actual source: https://t.co/AEcSOOxNv4</p><p>?__>You can see it adds some abortive roads north from Baldur's Gate, but otherwise reverts back to the errors of 1st Edition.</p><p>?__>This is what the actual map from the revised Gold Box looks like.</p><p></p><p>It largely follows the Atlas, except it downgrades the "Coast Way". https://t.co/goNXrxssN2</p><p>?__>I spent some time trying to figure out how these maps related to each other, but I have come to the conclusion that both the Atlas and the 2nd Edition map are based on a common source: Ed Greenwood's original maps. https://t.co/iW36y7jtzl</p><p>?__>They were apparently displayed at Gamehole Con last year and you can view some photos here:</p><p></p><p>https://t.co/QE6wLUUg3R</p><p>?__>Note the lack of a road between Elturel and Scornubel.

It's obviously a regression in terms of detail, but also has a number of glaring inaccuracies. (The road crossing the river far to the east of Baldur's Gate is the most notable.)</p><p></p><p>We'll mostly ignore this. https://t.co/ZmBPTEVhta</p><p>?__>The other notable thing here is that the writers of 4th Edition also wondered why the Trade Way would go all the way east to Scornubel if there was a road heading straight to Baldur's Gate.</p><p></p><p>Their solution was simple: It doesn't. In 4E, the Trade Way no longer goes to Scornubel. https://t.co/lAOYIMm5ob</p><p>?__>Which brings us to 5th Edition.</p><p></p><p>For 5E's cartography they apparently went back to the original 1E maps. The goal was presumably to sort of "get back to basics," but the result was to reintroduce the errors of the original map.</p><p></p><p>Including the gap. https://t.co/R7CHxTMBSS</p><p>?__>When I started this thread I was primarily aiming to just say, "Hey. Look at that gap!"</p><p></p><p>But it turns out there's some deeper lore here.</p><p>?__>Specifically, if you do a close reading of the 1E boxed set (which I just did), you'll discover that the entire idea of there being a single "Trade Way" is an illusion.</p><p></p><p>There was a Trade Way from Amn to Waterdeep: https://t.co/UjQki30Spo</p><p>?__>But there was another Trade Way, from Waterdeep to Iriaebor. https://t.co/iKxUJaJW61</p><p>?__>And it is this second Trade Way that goes to Scornubel. The reason there's no road from Scornubel to Baldur's Gate (and why Elturel is explicitly not on the Trade Way), is because there IS no Trade Way between Baldur's Gate and Scornubel.</p><p></p><p>They're two different Trade Ways.</p><p>?__>(My suspicion would be that there were originally many more Trade Ways. These were just the ones that got particular mention in the first boxed set.)</p><p>?__>In the 2nd Edition boxed set, the addition of the "Coast Way" was an attempt to make the difference between the two routes clearer.</p><p></p><p>(For example, in this boxed set, Baldur's Gate is no longer on the Trade Way, it is only on the Coast Way. They are two different things.)</p><p>?__>But I suspect due to all the prominent references to Baldur's Gate being "on the Trade Way" and "the Trade Way follows the coast" that already existed, this became confused.</p><p>?__>In short order, the Coast Way was effectively just another name for the Trade Way. And it was soon explicitly stated to be so, reintroducing the confusion.</p><p></p><p>4E, as noted above, attempted to resolve it by taking Scornubel off the Trade Way.</p><p>?__>(Although incoherently, the same 4e campaign guide still asserted that the Trade Way crossed the Boareskyr Bridge. Which, of course, it cannot possibly do if it's following the road to Baldur's Gate.) https://t.co/bZj8hXqGlJ</p><p>?__>Of course, this means that there's ANOTHER gap in the Trade Way on the 1E maps. This one between Scornubel and Iriaebor. https://t.co/r1S4NjvFKk</p><p>?__>Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be clear solution. This section of the photo of Greenwood's map is difficult to make out details on.

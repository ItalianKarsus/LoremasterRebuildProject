<h1>Loremaster 2009 Interview Reconstruction Project</h1>
<p>by Italian Karsus</p>
<h2>Brief Overview</h2>
<p>Loremaster.org went down in 2010, and when it came back up, the interactive interviews in the site were not restored, resulting in the loss of a number of answers by several authors, including Ed Greenwood's. Uniquely, Ed Greenwood's answers are considered canon Realmslore by the Forgotten Realms Wiki, and thus, I am interested in retrieving as much of its original text as possible. I know it's 2023 (2024 now), but waiting still doesn't get us closer, so maybe let's do this now rather that after the robots take over.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>My first finds were only those posted by Snowblood to dA, where he cites a few segments on a work of homebrew regarding Illefarn and Sharrven to Ed Greenwood's interviews.</p>
<p>I hardly managed any more of a finding for months after, until I caught a glimpse of something in the archived version of loremaster dot org. One of the questions by user Vercingetorix had been discussed, and a bit of the answer too.</p>
<p>Then a few months later, I was given a link to an archived version of the Wizards of the Coast forums, where I was able to track down a few more answers from Loremaster being discussed.</p>
<p>By mere chance, on 04/01/2024, I found a last answer discussed and paraphrased in Candlekeep.</p>
<p>So now on 11/01/2024 I moved this to a github page, so I can edit it without bugging the peeps over at Candlekeep forums. I ramble a lot.</p>

<h2>Current finds</h2>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>First of all, I'm dividing the finds between seven sections (effectively five) Those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Section 1: The first answer of all on August 14 2009.</li>
<li>Section 2: The answers between then and September 18, 2009. There was a total of 13 answers at the end of this span. Thus, this span contains twelve answers.</li>
<li>Section 3: The answers between September 18 and November 01, 2009. There were 77 answers at the end of this span. Thus, this span contains sixty-four answers.</li>
<li>Section 4: The answers between November 01 and December 02, 2009. There were 84 answers at the end of this span: thus, this span contains only seven answers.</li>
<li>Section 5: The answers between December 02 2009 and January 06, 2010. There were 89 answers at the end of this span, and thus, five answers through.</li>
<li>Section 6: The answers between January 06 and June 02, 2010. There were 91 answers at the end of this span, and thus, it holds two answers.</li>
<li>Section 7: The answers between June 02 and the end. 91 answers remained all the way to October 04, so there were none in that span. There may well be none past that end line.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Section 1: The First Answer of All (1/1 answer)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The answer is not paraphrased; in the discussion, however, people agree that the elves of the Yuirwood were likely Eladrin, as is Ed's view.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Section 2: August 14 - September 18, 2009 (3/12 answers)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>One answer is cited, apparently in full, at Candlekeep.</p>
<p><i>I'm more comfortable with playing a character, and like "gaming the system" a lot less; I dislike sitting around a gaming table at which players who don't bother to act/roleplay are all running multi-classed characters complete with "unusual" races, multiple templates and special skills, just so they can "get ahead of other characters" and dominate. To me, that takes the game away from roleplaying and into wargaming - - and if we're wargaming, I'd personally rather play a strategy game with hexes and simulations, than try to play D&D. I want to try to imagine myself in the midst of a fantastical setting and situations, not hover "above it all" and participate in quarterback-like "you do this, then I'll try that" discussions with fellow players, or (as a player, not DM) have to pay more attention to game rules than to roleplaying. I'm not a gamer who plays to win; I play to have a good time.
Race, gender, etc. don't matter to me in terms of preferences; I'll have a go at anyone/anything.</i></p>

<li><p>Two answers are reported to be here, relating to the conversation linked, by BladeinAmn as of September 19 2009. They explain the answers were in the 17th and 18th respectively, and related to intentions while Realmsbuilding. They are assumed not to contain Realmslore.</p>

<li>Nine answers are still unrecovered, likely unrecoverable.
</ul>

<h3>Section 3: September 18 - November 01, 2009 (6.1/64 answers)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>One of the answers to the_silversword here is paraphrased and linked back to the Loremaster interactive interviews. The answer is first discussed in September 24, and thus cannot go any further back than that. Their join date is September 22, and thus it can't go any further back than that. It belongs either here, or in Section 2. The part where Ed confirms he wrote Hoar isn't copied; instead, this is.</p>
<p><i>"Here's the real secret: if you read my Realms novels, you'll occasionally "hear" characters swearing by "all the Watching Gods."
Well, unbeknownst to all but a few sages and ancient elves, that phrase, "the Watching Gods," refers to an old, old belief among intelligent races that there are far fewer actual gods than most mortals believe, and that these fewer "Watching Gods" are unwittingly worshipped under several names by clergies and devout lay followers who see them as a variety of different beings. Some sages believe the gods themselves are partially or wholly unaware that they are "split personalities" or "aspects" of the same mighty being, while others cling to the view that this is a deliberate deception (insurance, if you will, on the part of a divine being that they will always be venerated regardless of whether this or that named god falls out of favour). A few sages believe Ao and the goddess of magic best known as Mystra are the only "uber-gods" mortals have glimpsed, and that the others are hidden behind their arrays of names (for example, just one being is behind Silvanus, Eldath, Mielikki, and most of the other nature deities).
No mortal knows the truth behind all of this, mind you, so a DM can decide whatever he or she wishes - - or choose to NOT decide, being as they can arrange matters so that mortals (including PCs) never know.
(Here, I believe, is where I'm supposed to make "Bwoohahahaha" noises.)"</i></p>

<li><p>User "quale" mentions Ed Greenwood in a thread, and links to Loremaster, though not to the interactive persistent interviews. I make the assumption those were still interview questions; thankfully it is not a Realmslore question, and I'll consider it as having been, though not preserved, discarded.</p><a href='http://candlekeep.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=12908'>http://candlekeep.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=12023&whichpage=84</a>

<li><p>Sanishiver makes a reference to the October 22 answer on Loremaster dot org in the REALMS-L mailing list, in a mail from December 10, 2010, regarding a character he has designed: Forthin Andramar. However, it holds no copy or paraphrase, just the way he used it in making his own homebrew War Wizards; all we know is that this is when the Bel's Blade is mentioned. <b>It was October 22, 2009.</b></p>

<li><p>Another answer was brought up, however, briefly, on October 27, 2009 by sfdragon. In context, it appeared to be recent. I assume sfdragon was Steelfiredragon in Loremaster: if so, his join date is the 19th of September, and cannot have asked before that time.</p>
<p>hey dookie, The Most Esteamed Ed Greenwood has replied that the Thunderblessing is heavily NDA'd</p>

<li><p>Another NDA was discussed by sfdragon, later on October 27 2009. The Volo NDA was not in Candlekeep, so it is assumed to have been brought up in Loremaster. However, it may have been from an earlier questioner, too.</p>
<p>not as interesting tht RAvencloak is also NDA</p>

<p><b>Volo is NDA'd</b></p>

<li><p>The_silversword made an oblique reference to a question regarding the Roll of Years in October 29, 2009, strongly implying one question about the Roll of Years was answered by citing an NDA.</p>
<p>Interesting discussion going on here. I'm not sure if it could really be answered. I have a feeling an "official" answer would be something like "However you want to do it in your campaign". Personaly I agree that the souls are one with the Plane and the God, so if the god and plane are destyoed, so then are all them souls, however I think Kelemevor has some jurisdiction there and he does have the Fate domain, so maybe he knew something was up and lead souls he deemed worthy to safety? I personaly dont want to see all of Mystras faithful souls get obliterated, now all them Dark Dwarf souls can burn for all I care!</p>

<p>you could ask, but you might get a nda answer</p>

<p>That wouldn't surprise me at all. I am so sick of NDAs. <b>Even ED's answer to my roll of years question was NDAd.</b> Like I'm going to go oh I know all the year names for the next 100 years so I dont need to buy anymore Realms products. They really need to do something with all those outstanding NDAs that will moslt likely never see the light of day, Like make a massive Realmslore article or something. Theyre sitting on a gold mine of Realmslore and should really do something with it.</p>


<li><p>Another answer is cited by user sfdragon on October 30, 2009.</p>
<p>btw from my latest qusestion to Ed Greenwood, concerning Laeral ARunson</p>

<p><i>ed3.pngI'm afraid Laeral's fate is firmly NDA'd at this time. Sorry.
I can promise you'll learn SOME fates of SOME Chosen in a year or so.
Ed</i></p>

<li>Thus, there are ultimately six confirmed answers (between non-lore questions, fully retained questions, and NDAs invoked), one with content identified, and fifty-seven unknowns.
</ul>

<h3>Section 4: November 01 - December 02, 2009 (0/7 answers)</h3>

<h3>Section 5: December 02, 2009 - January 06, 2010 (0/5 answers)</h3>


<h3>Section 6: January 06 - June 02, 2010 (1/2 answers)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>One of the questions was paraphrased on January 19 2010, by user sfdragon in the Wizards of the Coast forums, in January 19 2010. He quotes it as a recent answer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that one is heavily NDA'd. Sorry. There are a lot of matters Realmsian I'd love to talk about, but can't - -and, yes, that's one of them. Cool things, moonblades, so lots of writers, designers, DMs, and players want to play with them.</p>
<li>Thus, there is one more answer, yet unknown, between January 6 and June 02.
</ul>
